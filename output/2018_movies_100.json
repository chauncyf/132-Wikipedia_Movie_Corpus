    "Text": "2.0 is a 2018 Indian Tamil-language science fiction action film written and directed by S. Shankar. Produced by Subaskaran under the banner of Lyca Productions. As the second installment in the Enthiran franchise, 2.0 is a standalone sequel to Enthiran (2010), featuring Rajinikanth reprising the roles of Vaseegaran and Chitti, alongside Akshay Kumar and Amy Jackson. Sudhanshu Pandey, Adil Hussain, Kalabhavan Shajohn, and K. Ganesh appear in supporting roles. The film follows the conflict between Chitti, the once dismantled humanoid robot, and Pakshi Rajan, a former ornithologist who seeks vengeance upon cell phone users to prevent avian population decline. The soundtrack is composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Madhan Karky and Na. Muthukumar.\nProduced on an estimated budget of \u20b9543 crore (US$76 million), 2.0 is the most expensive Indian film to date. Production began in 2015, with principal photography conducted at AVM Studios later that year. The first schedule was filmed at EVP World. Scenes were primarily shot in India, particularly in Chennai's Madras Boat Club and Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. Filming was completed by August 2017. The film is the first in Indian cinema to be natively shot in 3D, which was done by cinematographer Nirav Shah. Legacy Effects made their return to construct prosthetic makeup and animatronics, with visual effects supervised by V. Srinivas Mohan. Editing was handled by Anthony and production design was conducted by T. Muthuraj.\n2.0 was released worldwide in both 3D and conventional format on 29 November 2018, along with its dubbed versions in Hindi and Telugu. It received generally positive reviews upon release. Critics particularly praised the film's visual effects, performances of Rajinikanth and Kumar, and social message; the pace and screenplay received criticism. It earned \u20b9117.34 crore (US$16 million) worldwide on its first day, which was the second highest ever for an Indian film. The film crossed \u20b9520 crore (US$72 million) in its opening weekend to be the highest-grossing film worldwide for that week. 2.0 is the second highest-grossing film in India and is the sixth highest-grossing Indian film worldwide.\n\nPlot\nVaseegaran introduces Nila, his new humanoid robot, to a group of students. Shortly thereafter, a student's smartphone suddenly starts flying, exhibiting avian characteristics. Before long, cell phones all over Chennai begin to fly away, leaving the city in chaos. At an emergency council meeting initiated by the government, Vaseegaran enunciates that it is beyond conventional science to fight what he considers a fifth force, and proposes reinstating Chitti, which was dismantled in 2010. But Dhinendra Bohra, who lost his father to Chitti's anger, opposes, and the council decides to seek help from the military, thereby vetoing Vaseegaran's proposal.\nThe growing stream of cell phones leaves havoc in its path, killing a mobile phone wholesaler Jayanth Kumar, a transmission tower owner Manoj Lulla, and the state's telecom minister Vaira Moorthy. To prevent further damage, S. Vijay Kumar, the Home Minister, unofficially gives Vaseegaran permission to rebuild Chitti. Chitti traces the mobile phones.\nVaseegaran then learns from Chitti that the bird is powered by the aura of a human being, which exudes negative energy. The radiation from the antennae of such signal transmitters and auras of other living organisms are positively charged while those of the dead are negatively charged, allowing the parabolic transmitters to repel the bird. Had it entered the electromagnetic field produced by the transmitters, the radiation from the antennae would  neutralize the bird, preventing it from reassembling. Vaseegaran replicates a smaller version of those transmitters to destroy the bird. During neutralization, Vaseegaran learns that the negative aura is from Pakshi Rajan.\nPakshi Rajan used to be an ornithologist who owned the now abandoned house where birds would come and live with him. Gradually, high-frequency radiation from the newly set up cell towers starts killing the birds due to the rapid growth of mobile phone industries. Pakshi then visits Jayanth Kumar, Manoj Lulla, and the telecom minister in order to request them to stop their unjust and unlawful activities but it is in vain. He also organizes conferences and protests against the exorbitant use of cell phones but receives no support. Ultimately, all his birds die, and a distraught Pakshi Rajan hangs himself to death from a cell tower. His life energy, along with that of numerous dead birds, combine together to form an aura that manipulates mobile phones into any form through electromagnetic radiation.\nChitti reactivates the transmitters and neutralizes Pakshi, storing his energy in a containment circuit. But jealous of Chitti's resurgence, Dhinendra sneaks into the AIRD Institute and frees Pakshi's aura from the containment circuit. The aura enters Vaseegaran, enabling Pakshi Rajan to possess his body and attack humans. Chitti hesitates to kill him, as it would mean killing Vaseegaran too. Taking advantage of this, Pakshi disassembles Chitti.\nNila takes Chitti back to the lab and rebuilds its body, replacing its microchip with the red chip created by Bohra, which results in Chitti's violent configuration, version 2.0, being in control. Nila constrains it from harming anyone but Pakshi Rajan. Chitti then creates more versions of its likeness. Meanwhile, Pakshi takes over a crowded football stadium and exposes Dhinendra to radiation from the nearby cell towers, incinerating and killing him. Chitti, along with its army of robots, arrives and confronts him, resulting in a battle between the two. However, its battery drains, and it rushes to the nearest power station. During this time, microbots resembling Chitti, called Kutti version 3.0, arrive mounted on white pigeons and confront Pakshi Rajan, who cannot kill the spectators now as it would mean that the pigeons would also get killed. At one point Pakshi's aura leaves Vaseegaran's body. The microbots then lead his aura to the signal transmission site, where Pakshi Rajan is eliminated. Vaseegaran recovers in the hospital and tells Vijay Kumar, who comes to see him, that he feels Pakshi Rajan was a virtuous person who became a victim of the corrupt society. He also suggests that everyone should limit the use of phones, and conserve the lives of birds as much as possible. Chitti, now restored to its original version, begins a relationship with Nila, to which Vaseegaran gives his consent.\nIn a post-credits scene, Sana asks Vaseegaran over the phone about the probability of mobile phones flying again. Immediately, Vaseegaran's mobile flies out of his hand and morphs into Kutti 3.0, saying, \"I am your grandson\".\n\nCast\nRajinikanth in three roles as\nVaseegaran, a scientist who created a sophisticated robot in his likeness with a desire to commission it into the Indian Army. He introduced the robot as Chitti.\nChitti, an advanced \"andro-humanoid\" robot. It was designed with a speed capacity of 1 Terahertz (Hz) and a memory capacity of 1 Zettabyte.\nKutti, a microbot created by Chitti 2.0,  that can transform and disguise itself as a mobile phone.\nAkshay Kumar as Pakshi RajanAn ornithologist who operated a bird sanctuary, Pakshi Rajan protests excessive use of mobile phones fearing that high-frequency electromagnetic radiation from cell sites is threatening avian life. He reports it to Jayanth, the telecommunications minister, and Manoj, but they disregard the matter intentionally. Deeply frustrated, Pakshi hangs himself to death from a cell tower. Now his aura, combined with the negative energy of deceased birds, can control cell phones with electromagnetic radiation, which happens to be considered a fifth force. Pakshi's Tamil and Telugu voice is dubbed by Jayaprakash.Amy Jackson as NilaA domestic and feminine humanoid robot created by Vaseegaran, whose name is a contraction of \"Nice, Intelligent, Lovely Assistant\". This robot is meant to be a friend, helper, and caretaker. It can drive, perform forensic analysis, jump walls and disable electronic alarms. Later, it falls in love with Chitti. Nila's Tamil and Telugu voice is dubbed by Raveena Ravi.Sudhanshu Pandey as Dhinendra \"Dhina\" BohraA scientist and the son of Dr. Bohra, who was once killed by Chitti. After his father's death, Dhina assumes the robot to be Vaseegaran's alter-ego and wishes to take revenge on him. He happens to be the first person to voice against the reinstatement of Chitti in the government meeting. Later, he also becomes jealous of Chitti's resurgence and, sneaking into the AIRD Institute, he frees Pakshi's aura from the containment circuit.Adil Hussain as Minister S.

By March 2011, the original film's cinematographer, Rathnavelu, revealed that initial pre-production work on a sequel had begun with the same technical team. S. Shankar, the director of Enthiran, moved on to work on Nanban (2012) and I (2015) and planned to reunite with the same producers as the original was released, with Shankar revealing that he was unsure if the film \"will happen at all\" during an interview in 2014. While finishing the production of I, Shankar drafted the scripts of three more feature films, including a sequel to Enthiran.Pre-production work for the film had reportedly started in June 2015 with Lyca Productions deciding to finance the project. Along with Shankar and Rajinikanth, composer A. R. Rahman and editor Anthony remained on the development team for the sequel, while Jeyamohan was added to write the screenplay. Shankar also began briefing the film's art director T. Muthuraj and visual effects supervisor V. Srinivas Mohan about their involvement in the film. Shankar had initially inquired about K. V. Anand's availability. This was before Nirav Shah joined the technical team as a cinematographer in mid-2015 and visited specialist studios in the United States to research filming methods for 3D shoots.Jeyamohan finished work on the script of the film in September 2015 and revealed that the story would be a direct continuation of the 2010 film, with filming only set to start following the completion of Rajinikanth's commitments in Kabali (2016). The original film's screenplay writer, Madhan Karky, helped Jeyamohan on some of the more technical dialogue in the script. While the film does include characters and references to events from its predecessor, it is primarily a standalone sequel. A press release coinciding with the start of the film's shoot also revealed that Resul Pookutty would handle sound designing, Legacy Effects would take care of animatronics work, and Mary E. Vogt would design special costumes. Stunt choreographer Kenny Bates and visual effects specialists John Hughes and Walt Jones were also signed to work on the film. Unadjusted for inflation, 2.0 is so far the most expensive Indian film.\n\nCasting\nShankar held initial discussions with Kamal Haasan, Aamir Khan, and then Vikram about portraying a further role, though none of the three actors signed on to appear in the film. Subsequently, the team held talks with Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger for the role, who agreed to work on the film for a record remuneration. The makers then opted against signing Schwarzenegger, though there have been conflicting reasons regarding this decision. British actress Amy Jackson signed on to work on the film in October 2015 and visited Los Angeles as a part of the team's pre-production work. In late November 2015, Rajinikanth also travelled to Los Angeles to meet the film's producers and complete costume trials and initial motion capture effects work for the film. After further negotiations with actors including Hrithik Roshan and Neil Nitin Mukesh, the makers signed on Akshay Kumar to portray the role for which Schwarzenegger was initially considered.Sudhanshu Pandey joined the cast of the film during March 2016 and revealed that he would portray a scientist who is the son of Professor Bohra from the original film. Adil Hussain began working on the film in July 2016, and, as a part of his role, undertook extensive research into the life of news reporters. In September 2016, Malayalam actor Kalabhavan Shajohn confirmed that he had tried out for a role in the film after Shankar was impressed with his performance in Drishyam and had signed him on.\n\nFilming\nAn official launch event was to be held on 12 December 2015, coinciding with Rajinikanth's birthday. However, the team chose to avoid publicity as a result of the 2015 South Indian floods. Instead, the team held a low key launch event at the AVM Studios on 7 December, with the director and the producers in attendance. Titled 2.0, the film then began its first scheduled shooting on 16 December 2015 at a set erected in the outskirts of Chennai at EVP World. On the first day of the shoot, a scene featuring Rajinikanth and several dwarf actors was shot at the erected set, while the team's principal cast and crew also assembled for a photo shoot. The first schedule of the film, consisting of Rajinikanth and Amy Jackson, continued in Chennai until 30 December 2015. The team then worked on a second schedule throughout the middle of January 2016 in Chennai and shot scenes featuring Rajinikanth at Mohan Studios and by Madras Boat Club. Shankar continued filming portions not involving the lead actors throughout February 2016 in Chennai, with a car chase sequence shot in Royapettah. Another schedule to shoot a song was initially set to be held at Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia but was canceled due to bad weather, and the team opted not to travel to the country.Akshay began shooting for the film in Chennai at the beginning of March 2016 and took part in a schedule held at the EVP Film City studio in Chennai. A set of a mobile phone store was built on site, while night scenes involving robotic equipment and military tanks were also canned. The team subsequently moved to Delhi in order to hold a forty-five-day schedule, continuing on from the same scenes with military tanks that were shot in Chennai. Subsequently, the team filmed sequences at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium depicting an Indian Super League match between Chennaiyin FC and Mumbai City FC, with hundreds of junior artists recruited to act as supporters. Actors Amitabh Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan visited the film's set at the stadium with the media reporting that the pair were set to make cameo appearances, though the claim was later denied by the team. Rajinikanth then joined the team in Delhi at the end of March to continue shooting for the project, with the climax sequences being filmed. Action scenes incorporating robotic equipment were filmed throughout early April in Delhi, with cinematographer Nirav Shah using helicams to capture sequences involving the three lead actors.Another ten-day schedule took place in May 2016 in Chennai, with scenes being shot at the EVP Film City studios as well as at The Forum Vijaya shopping mall. During the shoot at the studios, the visual effects designer Srinivas Mohan digitally converted a green screen sequence into locations including the Red Fort and the Parliament from Delhi after the team were unable to secure shooting permission there. By June 2016, Shankar revealed that after one hundred days of shooting, scenes including the climax and two major action sequences had been completed and that the film was fifty per cent complete. Adil Hussain and Kalabhavan Shajohn began their work in the film during July 2016 in Chennai, while the rest of the cast were given an extended break after Rajinikanth fell ill. Production continued throughout August and early September 2016 without the lead actors in Saligramam in Chennai, where the team shot action sequences of luxury cars being blown up. Following his illness and subsequent recovery, Rajinikanth returned to the sets of the film in early October after a break of close to four months. He shot for scenes alongside Amy Jackson in Chennai, where he was featured fighting huge birds created using animatronic technology with actor Riyaz Khan also joining the cast. Soon after the schedule finished in early October, Shankar revealed that the film was two-thirds complete, following one hundred and fifty days of shooting.Another schedule began in early November at EVP Film City in Chennai with all of the lead cast and continued throughout the month. All filming was completed except for one song that featured a set erected in Chennai. Jackson was given ten days of practice by choreographer Bosco. Filming was completed in August 2017. Principal photography was concluded on 22 October 2017.\n\nMusic\nIn 2015, during pre-production phase of the film, it was announced that A. R. Rahman would be composing the soundtrack and original score of 2.0.\nIn an interview with Archana Chandhok on Zee Tamil, Rajinikanth revealed that director Shankar wanted to make 2.0 without any songs. Plans for recording a title track and a background song failed. The track \"Enthira Logathu Sundariye\" made its way after taking into account that the screenplay of the film was entirely subject-oriented and moves at a frenetic pace. Keeping audiences in consideration, a \"breather\" form of a song was recorded. However, Rahman was still not convinced and felt that an album should have a minimum of four songs to provide listeners with a wholesome experience.In an interview with Press Trust of India, Rahman stated that 2.0 was a tough film to score. Recording of \"Endhira Logathu Sundariye\" was completed by early August 2017. The song, reported as a romantic number with dance included, was shot indoors in a 12-day schedule in August 2017. Recording of the Hindi version (\"Mehanical Sundariye\") of the track was completed on October 29, 2017.A promotional music event for releasing two songs \"Endhira Logathu Sundariye\" and \"Raajali\" was held at Burj Al Arab, Dubai on October 27, 2017. Both these tracks were released on digital music platforms the same day. A. R. Rahman and his music team performed these two songs and an additional track \"Pullinangal\" at the event. A symphony of an estimated 125 musicians was present to perform live. \"Pullinangal\"'s Hindi version (\"Nanhi Si Jaan\") was recorded in June 2018. The track \"Pullinangal\" was released as a part of the soundtrack album on November 6, 2018. About this, Rahman stated that he initially wanted to release more background themes rather than songs.\nRecording of the original score began in London and Rahman's Los Angeles studios in 2016. Unlike previous projects, Rahman began finalizing the original background score six months back prior to release because he felt that the scenes were very heavy and it needed a lot of work.\n\nTrack listing\nMarketing and release\nIn November 2016, it was revealed that 2.0 was scheduled for release during Diwali on 18 October 2017. In April 2017, Raju Mahalingam, the film's former producer, announced that the film's release had been postponed to 25 January 2018 citing better incorporation of visual effects. The release date was later moved to 14 April 2018. The release date was once again moved to 27 April 2018 but instead Kaala took that spot resulting in another delay of the film. The making video of the film was revealed on 25 August 2017. The film, which contains approximately 1,000 visual effects shots according to producers, was delayed numerous times while the computer-generated imagery (CGI) work was being completed by numerous effects studios. The film was finally slated to be released in cinemas on 29 November 2018.The teaser of 2.0 was released on Ganesh Chaturti, 13 September 2018, in both 3D and 2D. The 3D version was positively received, while some expressed disappointment with the 2D. Its 2D teaser video has been viewed over 32 million times in 24 hours. The film topic was trended and top searched queries on Google Trends for a week. But the teaser did not mention the release date. According to the source, \"There may be a lot of VFX work left in the film and they do not want to delay things too much. This is why, the makers Lyca Productions  seem to have put out the teaser so that they can keep the audiences busy.\" In addition to its original language, the film will be released in 14 other languages with dubbed versions. The film has recovered approximately \u20b9370 crore (US$51 million) from satellite, digital and music rights. This includes, but is not limited to, about \u20b9110 crore (US$15 million) for satellite and digital rights and \u20b950 crore (US$7.0 million) for digital rights, the latter sold to Amazon Prime Video.Ahead of the film's release, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) lodged a complaint, demanding that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) certificate of the film be revoked for \"promoting anti-scientific attitudes towards mobile phones and cellular networks\". The organisation alleged the producers \"falsely depicting mobile phones and mobile towers as harmful to living creatures and the environment including birds and human beings\". Meanwhile, a Lyca Productions spokesperson said, \"We are under no obligation to toe the line and the film does not hunt or defames [sic] anyone.\" Various studies in India have proven that electromagnetic radiation from cell sites has a detrimental effect on bird health.In China, the film is set to release on 19 May 2019 in 10,000 theatres with 56,000 screenings, which includes 47,000 3D screenings, reportedly the largest release ever for an Indian film in the country, with a Mandarin dub and subtitles.\n\nReception\nBox office\n2.0 was released in about 6900 screens in India and over 2000 screens overseas. On its opening day, 2.0 earned about \u20b980 crore (US$11 million) gross collection in India (all versions), which was the second highest ever for an Indian film after Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017)'s \u20b9154 crore (US$21 million). This was around \u20b964 crore nett. Its worldwide gross was over \u20b9117.34 crore (US$16 million), which was also the second highest worldwide collection for an Indian film on its first day after Baahubali 2. On its second day, the film went on to be number one at the Australian box office. In Malaysia, the film had an all-time highest opening for any Tamil film. On its second day, the film earned around \u20b945 crore nett in India. The all-India business of 2.0 increased to \u20b956-57 crore nett on Saturday (the third day) owing to positive word-of-mouth in North India, while the collections in South India saw a minor drop. Its all-India total increased to \u20b9165.5 crore nett. On its third day, the film earned around \u20b9290 crore (US$40 million) worldwide in all languages, including \u20b985 crore (US$12 million) from overseas markets.At the American box office, the film surpassed the lifetime business of Rajinikanth's previous film Lingaa (2014) in just two days. The film debuted at number 11 at the American box office, earning $4.09 million. The screen count was increased from 20 to 75 in Pakistan on its second day to meet the demand. 2.0 grossed US$14.75 million (\u20b91.03 billion) in first five days in overseas markets. On its fourth day, a Sunday, business picked up over India, which led the film to accumulate an opening weekend collection of around \u20b9400 crore (US$56 million), the highest amount earned by any film in the week of 29 November to 2 December, ahead of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018). Collections in India, discounting overseas, were \u20b9291 crore (US$40 million) gross (\u20b9229 crore nett) in all languages. This pushed it ahead of Enthiran, which was the previous highest-grossing film from Tamil cinema with an earning of \u20b9205 crore nett in India. In its four-day opening weekend, the film opened at number one at the United Arab Emirates box office, earning $2.5 million, ahead of Creed II (2018).On its fifth day, the film earned around \u20b9451 crore (US $56 million) worldwide in all languages, including \u20b9114 crore (US $16 million) from international markets. In North India, its Hindi version earned around \u20b9111 crore (US $16 million). Along with the sixth day business of \u20b924 crore nett, the film earned \u20b9282.31 crore nett in India. It did record business in the southern Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. By the end of seven days, the film earned \u20b9480 crore (US$67 million) worldwide, which included \u20b9362 crore (US$50 million) in India and US$15 million (\u20b91.18 billion) in overseas markets. The extended first week worldwide collection was \u20b9520 crore (US$72 million).\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, 2.0 has a 75% approval rating based on 12 reviews and an average rating of 6.5/10.\n\nIndia\n2.0 received generally positive reviews from critics in India. Shankar's direction, visual effects, performances of Rajinikanth and Kumar, suspense and social message received  praise, while the introduction, script, and dialogues drew criticism. Taran Adarsh gave the film five stars out of five and applauded Shankar as \"a visionary... He hits the ball out of the park this time. Akshay Kumar is fantastic, while Rajinikanth is the boss\". A critic for Bollywood Hungama gave it four and a half stars out of five and similarly commended Shankar, \"[His] direction is highly effective and he proves once again why he's one of our best filmmakers. He doesn't get overwhelmed by the technology available and makes correct use of it\". S Subhakeerthana of The Indian Express gave it four stars out of five: \"Shankar has raised the bar in filmmaking in terms of visualisation, grandeur, and every frame of his fascinates you as a viewer\". Business Today's Ramesh Bala gave it four stars out of five, and found Kumar to be the film's spotlight: \"He has rocked both as Birdman and as a normal man in an emotional flashback\".Writing for Hindustan Times, Raja Sen rated 2.0 three and a half stars out of five, terming Rajinikanth as \"smarter than a smartphone\" and counted him and Kumar among the film's strengths. A critic for the Indo-Asian News Service also gave three and a half stars out of five and wrote, \"Unlike most science-fiction films, 2.0 takes the commercial route to entertain, thus does come across as illogical at places, but that's what makes it insanely fun\". Devesh Sharma of Filmfare also gave three and a half stars out of five. M. Suganth of The Times of India gave it three stars out of five; he stated that there is a sense of \"just going through the motions in the first half,\" but found that the action sequences and chemistry between the leads helped keep the film enjoyable for most of its run-time. Writing for Film Companion, Anupama Chopra also gave the film three stars out of five: \"2.0 is visually overpowering \u2013 the VFX are mostly first-rate \u2013 but the screenplay doesn't offer the seamless mix of romance, drama and comedy [as the predecessor]\".Janani K, film critic for India Today, gave 2.0 three stars out of five and appreciated the film's theme, but felt it could be better presented, writing, \"Though it is a much-need message, it could have been explained in an intriguing manner rather than the pedantic treatment it gets\". Rajeev Masand also gave it three stars out of five. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film two stars out of five, describing it as \"dull as ditchwater in the first half, perking up a little in the second, with a half-way watchable Akshay Kumar, and a Rajinikanth coming into his own right towards the end, for a bit\". Pragati Saxena of National Herald concurred with Gupta and criticized the pace and dullness of the film. Writing for CNN-News18, Rohit Vats also rated two stars out of five and criticised the writing, opining, \"[Shankar's] characters haven't evolved the way the world around them has\". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV also gave two stars out of five and said, \"Bunkum is bunkum no matter how big the bucks behind it are\".\n\nOverseas\nSimon Abrahams of RogerEbert.com gave the film three and a half stars out of four and stated, \"Against all reason\u2013against all common sense\u20132.0 works, and in a big, big way\". Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters wrote, \"This film certainly has the look and feel of a big-ticket Hollywood production, and that alone is worth the price of the ticket\". Kumar Shyam of The National gave it three and a half stars out of five and wrote, \"2.0 is a very clever spectacle not to be missed for its sheer audacity and scale\". Rafael Motamayor of Polygon wrote, \"2.0's biggest draw is its impressive use of visual effects, and the film doesn't waste a moment to showcase its budget\". He felt \"[t]he effects [were] detailed enough to stand against a $200 million-dollar American blockbuster\".\n\nAccolades\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n2.0 at Box Office Mojo\n2.0 on IMDb \n2.0 on Bollywood Hungama\n2.0 on Facebook"

    "Text": "2nd Half is a 2018 crime-thriller film in Kannada, directed by debutant Yogi Devegange and produced by Nagesh under the banner Brindavan Enterprises and stars Priyanka Upendra, Surabhi Santosh and Niranjan Sudhindra in the lead. The cinematography is by R K Shivakumar and music direction is handled by Chetan Sosca.\n\nBackground\nTalking about her character in 2nd Half, Priyanka Upendra was quoted saying \"The movie's content is such that it talks about the khakhi profession and highlights how juniors are treated insignificantly by seniors. It becomes very difficult to make yourself \u2018heard'.\"  While explaining her interest to be part of new age cinema, she continues \"It's easy to do the tried-and tested methods. But it\u2019s hard to take the road less taken. The same applies for films and directors. One such is Yogi Devagange, a director who is open to taking risks. Which is why I like associating with him on work. Such roles, for me as an actor, are challenging. For example, when I first heard the story of 2nd Half, I felt that it was a story that would definitely work,\u201dIt also marks the entry of actor Upendra's nephew Niranjan into the Kannada film industry, on choosing 2nd half as a debut, he says  \"Since I've grown up being interested in theatre, I've closely observed my Uncle and his acting style. I've also understood the intricacies of camera work since I associated with him in Uppi-2. Initially, I was considering entering the industry after mastering every department. I wanted to hone my skills, come in as a complete package and become a director's actor. But when 2nd Half happened, I realised that it was the right film to debut with,\" says Niranjan, who consulted his uncle before taking the plunge into the industry. \" He felt that I shouldn't miss an opportunity that came knocking at his door. His words made me realise that it's okay to start small and scale up,\"\n\nPlot\nThe story talks about the life of a women police constable Anuradha (Priyanka Upendra) who assigned to the police CCTV control room. On her job, she gets intrigued by the life of a young girl, Saranya (Surabhi Santosh) who is a free-spirited artist. In her newfound interest in spotting this girl on CCTV, she witnesses the girl go missing one day through the CCTV which abruptly ends when the camera stops working. The rest of the story is about how she sets out on a mission to find the girl with the help of a local boy named Niru (Niranjan Sudhindra) who also happens to be Saranya's lover.\n\nCast\nPriyanka Upendra as Anuradha\nSurabhi Santosh as Saranya\nNiranjan Sudhindra as Niru\nShalini\nVeena Sundar\nSarath Lohitashwa\nRitesh Gowda\n\nReception\nThe film released on June 1, 2018 to mixed to positive reviews.\nTimes of India gave the film a 2/5 while stating \"The film unfurls at a sluggish pace and the songs in the film feel rather forced, too\"Cinema express mentioned that \"The premise of this crime plot is different enough from the rest to warrant attention. Just be warned of the slow build up.\" while giving it 3 on 5.The New Indian Express reviewed that \"Priyanka, on her part takes a lot of responsibility on her shoulders. Being the centre point of the film, she has gone as per the director's vision. For Niranjan, 2nd Half becomes a trial run, before he gets his next big picture. A little hardwork from his end, might help to mould his career. This is just the beginning and he has a long way to go. Surabhi Santhosh is the soul of the film with the revolving mostly around him. Even though she doesn't have much screen space, 2nd Half doesn't make for a complete picture without her.\" while eventually rating a 3 on 5.\n\n\n== References =="

Watch only because it\u2019s the better of the three options this Eid and because Pakistani cinema needs your support. Shaheera Anwar from The Express Tribune gave a positive review with a rating of 3.5/5, stating ''All in all, 7DMI boasts of power-packed performances which will keep you entertained, even if you don\u2019t quite take to the script.'' She praised the film's direction, dialogues and cast, and rewarded the film with the verdict as ''If you\u2019re looking for beautiful sets, hilarious punch lines and some PG-rated comedy, 7DMI is your best bet.''Another review was given by Khusro Mumtaz from The News International, who wrote ''By the end, the movie limps across the finish line in a completely predictable fashion.''Dawn's staff writer Anum Rehman Chagani gave 4 out of 5 stars, praising the direction and visual effects, and said ''7DMI wouldn't have been bearable if it wasn't so darn visually appealing.'' She feels that few scenes were inspired by other movies, and wrote ''While Fasih Bari Khan is an intelligent writer, no doubt about it, the movie's story was a let-down.'' She praised the performances, specially from Mahira Khan ''With every role she takes on, it's becoming evident she's on a mission to reinvent herself, step out of her comfort zone and grow as an actor.''Aamna Haider Isani of Something Haute described the film as ''As a film, 7 Din Mohabbat In is absurd. It's a suspension of all logic and senses, encouraging you to take creative control and believe in the impossible. It's also absurd enough to allow you to believe in love, magic and the unexpected.'' She appreciated the film's writing, direction and special effects, stating ''Kudos to Faisal Bari Khan for writing such an emancipated script and to Farjad and Meenu for directing it to perfection. Attention to detail and special effects in the film are commendable.''Asjad Khan of  HIP praised its visual effects and wrote that \" It\u2019s very safe to say that 7DMI has utilized CGI and sound design better than any other Pakistani film\". The editor also praised its screenplay and all in all praised the actors especially Mahira Khan and wrote \"In a very different role Mahira Khan proves that she is a versatile actress\".Amna Zaidi of  Siddy Says  praised the direction and wrote \"The directors have made sure everything, from the Karachi backdrop, to the background music, styling of characters, dialogues, action and comedy all play in harmony with each other delivering an entertaining flick\". She also praised the leading actors and complimented on Sheheryar Munawar, as \"Tipu played by Sheheryar Munawar is the highlight of the film, not only does he act like a dorkey 29 year old to perfection, he looks amazing on screen\" and  praised  Mahira Khan  and wrote \" Mahira is definitely on a roll and a journey to reinvent herself, and she is doing it like a boss. Her comic timing and expression show a new side of her, and you cant help fall in love with Neeli\u2019s firecracker of a character\".Aparita Bhandari of CBC Arts  praised the film for its stand for women empowerment , dealing with LGBT issues and more powerful hidden elementsMahwash Ajaz of Khaleej Times wrote in the final review that \"It incorporates elements and motifs that swirls around in a giant melting pot and presents viewers  a fresh, original comedic romance that is worth your money. It's the kind of film you take your friends and family to - for a fun Eid outing\".\n\nSee also\nList of Pakistani films of 2018\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n7 Din Mohabbat In on IMDb \nMatteela Films"

    "Text": "12 Strong (also known as 12 Strong: The Declassified True Story of the Horse Soldiers) is a 2018 American action war drama film directed by Nicolai Fuglsig and written by Ted Tally and Peter Craig. The film is based on Doug Stanton's non-fiction book Horse Soldiers, which tells the story of U.S. Army Special Forces sent to Afghanistan immediately after the September 11 attacks. The film stars Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Navid Negahban, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, William Fichtner, and Rob Riggle.\nPrincipal photography began in January 2017 in New Mexico. The film was released in the United States on January 19, 2018 by Warner Bros. Pictures, in standard and IMAX theaters. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and action but criticized the by-the-numbers execution and lack of hindsight of the War in Afghanistan.\n\nPlot\nMitch Nelson, a  US Army Captain with Green Berets Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595, is moving into a new home with his wife and daughter on September 11, 2001, after receiving an assignment to staff duty under LTC Bowers. As news of the devastating terrorist attacks that day break, Nelson volunteers to lead 595 into Afghanistan. Bowers initially refuses, but veteran soldier CW5 Hal Spencer, previously scheduled to retire, persuades Bowers to give Nelson command of 595 again, as well as volunteering himself for the deployment. After leaving their families, 595 travels to Uzbekistan on October 7, 2001. After being briefed and evaluated by COL Mulholland, Commander of 5th Special Forces Group, Nelson and 595 are picked to fight alongside Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum.\nODA 595 is inserted covertly in Afghanistan aboard an MH-47 Chinook flown by 160th SOAR. They land 40 miles south of Mazar-i Sharif, the country's fourth-largest city and a longtime stronghold of the Taliban, where they meet Dostum.  Six of the 12 members, led by Nelson, leave with Dostum to the mountains, while the other six remain in a fortified camp nicknamed \"The Alamo\" under Spencer's command. Dostum is attempting to capture the northern Afghanistan city, while battling Taliban leader Mullah Razzan, who rules local communities brutally under strict Sharia law, and has murdered several people, including Dostum's family. Although the warlord is initially skeptical of Nelson's abilities, Nelson gradually earns Dostum's respect. In one battle, however, Dostum makes a tactical error, costing several casualties. Nelson accuses Dostum of acting carelessly with the lives of his men and of withholding valuable information, while Dostum retorts that he still feels that Nelson, and the U.S., is not willing to pay the potential price of the conflict, and tells Nelson that he needs to use his heart and mind to \"be a warrior\" instead of a soldier. The two eventually reconcile, and, after splitting off a three-man element under SFC Sam Diller to strike a Taliban supply route, and being joined by Spencer's half of ODA 595, continue to work together. They win several victories with Dostum's leadership and manpower and American airpower, making significant progress towards Mazar-i Sharif. Suddenly, however, Spencer informs Nelson that another ODA, 555, has been dispatched to support Atta Muhammad, another Northern Alliance leader, who is Dostum's political rival. When Nelson is forced to tell Dostum, the furious warlord and his men promptly abandon 595.\nFollowing Dostum's departure, Nelson plans to continue operating against the Taliban with his Americans and the few Afghan fighters remaining with them. Encountering a large force of Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters and armored vehicles, ODA 595, rejoined by Diller and his element, uses air support to eliminate many of the fighters and most of the armor, but are discovered and attacked. Spencer is critically injured by a suicide bomber, and the team is about to be overrun under heavy Taliban and Al-Qaeda pressure when Dostum returns with his forces. Carrying out the US Army\u2019s first cavalry charge of the 21st century, the American and Northern Alliance forces disperse the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and Dostum tracks down and kills Razzan. After Spencer is medevaced, Nelson and Dostum continue to Mazar-i-Sharif but find Atta Muhammad has beaten them there. Against expectations, Dostum and Muhammad meet peacefully and put aside their differences. Impressed by Nelson and the Americans' efforts, Dostum gives Nelson his prized riding crop and tells him that he will always consider Nelson a brother and fellow fighter but remember that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires.

The capture of Mazar-i-Sharif by the Horse Soldiers and their counterparts is one of the US military's most stunning achievements.  Military planners predicted it would take two years. Task Force Dagger did it in three weeks. Al Qaeda considers this to be their worst defeat. Because their mission was classified, the men of Special Forces ODA 595 returned home to their everyday lives with no fanfare or public acknowledgment of the near impossible mission they completed. In 2014, General Dostum became Vice President of Afghanistan. Dostum and Mitch Nelson remain close friends to this day. In 2012, to honor their extraordinary heroism, a statue of a Horse Soldier was dedicated at the World Trade Center site.\"\n\nReception\nBox office\n12 Strong grossed $46.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $24.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $70.8 million, against a production budget of $35 million.In the United States and Canada, 12 Strong was released on January 19, 2018 alongside Den of Thieves and Forever My Girl, as well as the wide expansions of Phantom Thread, I, Tonya and Call Me by Your Name, and was projected to gross $15\u201320 million from 3,002 theaters in its opening weekend. It ended up debuting to $15.8 million, similar to the $16.1 million that war film 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi opened to in January 2016, and finished second at the box office behind Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. According to ComScore, 55% of the opening weekend audience was male, with 79% being over the age of 25. The following week dropped 45% to $8.6 million, finishing 6th at the box office.\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 157 reviews, and an average rating of 5.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"12 Strong has a solid cast, honorable intentions, and a thrilling, fact-based story \u2014 all of which are occasionally enough to balance a disappointing lack of depth or nuance.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave an 81% overall positive score and a 63% \"definite recommend\".Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying, \"...with a running time of two hours and 10 minutes, 12 Strong has at least 20 minutes of scenes that are either unnecessary or repetitive...[it] winds up being an almost-good film about some great American soldiers.\" Matt Bobkin of Exclaim! gave the film a 4 out of 10, calling it \"a lazy attempt at injecting something fresh into the 9/11 narrative.\"\n\nAccolades\nRelated links\n5th Special Forces Group\nAmerica's Response Monument\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n12 Strong, Warner Bros. website\n12 Strong on IMDb  \n12 Strong at AllMovie"

    "Text": "The 15:17 to Paris is a 2018 American biographical drama film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the autobiography The 15:17 to Paris: The True Story of a Terrorist, a Train, and Three American Heroes by Jeffrey E. Stern, Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos. The film stars Stone, Sadler, and Skarlatos as themselves and follows the trio as they stop the 2015 Thalys train attack; Judy Greer and Jenna Fischer also star.\nThe 15:17 to Paris was released in the United States on February 9, 2018, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received negative reviews from critics, who called it \"well-intentioned\" but \"strained to wring a full-length feature's worth of drama out of [an event] that was over in a few minutes\", and grossed $57 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.\n\nPlot\nSpencer Stone and Alek Skarlatos are attending a suburban Christian middle school. They bond over their interest in guns, and are often sent to the principal's office for disciplinary action. Once, while sent to the principal's office, they meet another student, who often misbehaves in school, Anthony Sadler, and the three become friends. Spencer and Alek are from single mother homes, and their mothers often stick up for them when called to the principal's office regarding their misconduct.\nWhile working part time at a smoothie shop, Spencer waits on a recruiter for the United States Marine Corps. He asks the recruiter what military branch he would select if he could go back. The recruiter replies that the Air Force pararescue save lives and \"seem to being doing fine work in the field.\" Spencer is intrigued and decides  that he wants to join up. So he begins working out to lose some extra weight. After several months of rigorous training and exercise, he gets into much better shape and enlists in the Air Force in hopes of becoming a Pararescueman.\nUpon completing basic training, Spencer takes his exams to qualify for pararescue school. But having poor depth perception, he is turned down. Upset, he chooses from the other Air Force options left to him, and is soon stationed abroad. His friend, Alek, enlisted in the Army, and has been deployed to Afghanistan. On Skype, Alek tells him that he is planning to visit his girlfriend in Germany, and the two decide to rendezvous there for their next leave. Spencer skypes Anthony, now a college student, and talks him into coming to Europe for a vacation, visiting Italy. Afterwards, the three meet in Germany and decide to go to Amsterdam. After a few days there, they finally decide to visit France after deliberation. They depart from Amsterdam Centraal station on the 15:17 train to Paris.\nOn the train, all seems well, until American-born Frenchman Mark Moogalian notices that one of the toilets has been occupied for an unusually long time. When he goes to investigate, a terrorist bursts out with an assault rifle. Another passenger, Damien A., grabs the terrorist by the neck and Moogalian manages to wrest the rifle from the terrorist but is then shot in the back with a 9mm pistol. Passengers begin to flee out of their seats and rush toward the forward cabins of the train, trying to escape. Eventually, the terrorist approaches the next car, where Spencer and his friends are sitting. The moment Spencer sees him, he springs into action. He decides that his only hope, and the only hope of the remaining passengers, is for him to try to defeat the terrorist. Spencer makes a desperate all-out sprint toward the terrorist in the hope of subduing him before being shot. By remarkable luck, the terrorist's weapon jams just as he is about to fire, and he is tackled by Spencer, who successfully disarms the terrorist. Seeing Spencer's progress in subduing the terrorist, Alek, Anthony, and other passengers join the effort to try to further overwhelm the terrorist, finally knocking him out. Spencer then stanches the bleeding by plugging the exit wound in Moogalian's neck with his fingers. The police at the next station enter the train fully armed, discovering that Spencer has subdued the terrorist, and they begin to treat his wounds, and the more serious ones of the shot passenger. Paramedics take Moogalian to the emergency room at a local hospital and he survives.\nIn a formal ceremony, Spencer, Alek and Anthony are recognized as heroes of France for their gallantry and bravery. The terrorist was later discovered to have been armed with over 300 rounds of ammunition with the apparent aim of using all of it to wreak havoc on all those who boarded the train. The odds of the particular misfire and jam of the cartridge in the terrorist's weapon was estimated on the scene as being over a thousand-to-one, and highly unlikely to have been in Spencer's favor. French officials at the ceremony to honor Spencer's selfless act acknowledge his bravery and he is awarded the French Legion of Honour in recognition of his act of courage. On September 22, 2015, Mark Moogalian was awarded the Legion of Honor by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande for his actions on the train.\n\nCast\nSpencer Stone as himself\nAnthony Sadler as himself\nAlek Skarlatos as himself\nMark Moogalian as himself\nIsabelle Risacher Moogalian as herself\nJudy Greer as Joyce Eskel, Spencer\u2019s mother\nJenna Fischer as Heidi Skarlatos, Alek\u2019s mother\nRay Corasani as Ayoub El-Khazzani\nChris Norman as himself\nP.

It was announced that Eastwood would begin casting immediately for a principal production start date of later that year. On June 21, 2017, it was announced that Eastwood had chosen Kyle Gallner, Jeremie Harris and Alexander Ludwig to star as Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler and Spencer Stone although offers had not yet been made.On July 11, 2017, it was announced that Eastwood had cast Sadler, Skarlatos and Stone as themselves in the film which will \"begin during their childhood and show their friendship leading up to the moment that changed their lives\". It was also announced that the film had commenced principal production. On July 13, 2017, Tony Hale and Thomas Lennon joined the cast as staff members of a school the lead three men attended as children. On August 1, 2017, Sinqua Walls was cast in the film for an unspecified role.\nMark Moogalian and Isabelle Risacher Moogalian were also cast as themselves in the film.\n\nRelease\nThe film was released in the United States on February 9, 2018. The film was originally rated R by the MPAA for \"a sequence of violence and bloody images\", but received a PG-13 rating upon appeal.\n\nHome media\nThe 15:17 To Paris was released on HD digital copies on May 1, 2018. The film was then released on Blu-ray and DVD on May 22, 2018.\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe 15:17 to Paris grossed $36.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $20.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $56.9 million, against a production budget of $30 million.In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Peter Rabbit and Fifty Shades Freed, and was projected to gross $10\u201315 million from 3,042 theaters in its opening weekend. It ended up making $12.6 million, finishing third at the box office behind its two fellow releases. The film dropped 40% in its second weekend to $7.6 million ($8.9 million over the four-day Presidents Day weekend), finishing fifth.\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 24% based on 152 reviews, and an average rating of 4.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The 15:17 to Paris pays clumsily well-intentioned tribute to an act of heroism, but by casting the real-life individuals involved, director Clint Eastwood fatally undermines his own efforts.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale.Writing for Showbiz411, Roger Friedman acknowledged the film's attempts to be different by casting the real-life men and said, \"If there\u2019s a problem with 15:17 it\u2019s that it\u2019s almost filmed like cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, certainly as the story unfolds. There\u2019s a lot of exposition and it seems slow. Again, a little patience wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone. Because when the kids\u2019 backstories switch to the main guys, Eastwood finds a groove. Forgive him if the entry seems clunky.\" Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film a positive review and wrote, \"But [Eastwood's] workmanlike absorption in the task at hand is precisely what makes this movie fascinating as well as moving. Its radical plainness is tinged with mystery.\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film two out of four stars, stating that \"[a] good 70% of [The 15:17 to Paris] is inert, its affable nothingness redeemed only by the laid-back charisma of three men\", although he praised the film's \"poker-faced sincerity\" and the \"superb\" climactic train scene.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nThe 15:17 to Paris on IMDb  \nThe 15:17 to Paris at AllMovie \nThe 15:17 to Paris at History vs. Hollywood"

    "Text": "96 is a 2018 Indian Tamil-language romance film written and directed by C. Prem Kumar, starring Vijay Sethupathi and Trisha Krishnan. The film, the directorial debut of Prem Kumar, was produced by S. Nanthagopal for Madras Enterprises and features a score and soundtrack composed by Govind Vasantha. Mahendiran Jayaraju and N. Shanmuga Sundaram handled the cinematography and R. Govindaraj edited the film, while the costumes were designed by Subhashree Kaarthik Vijay.\nThe film was released on 4 October 2018 to critical acclaim, with praise for its screenplay, direction, music and the performances of the two leading actors. It will be remade in Kannada as 99.\n\nPlot\nRamachandran aka Ram (Vijay Sethupathi) is a happy-go-lucky freelance photographer. He visits his high school during a trip and is overcome by memories. A reunion is fixed through their school WhatsApp group. At the reunion, Murali, Subhashini, Sathish (Ram's school friends) catch up. Murali hesitatingly mentions that Jaanu (Ram's childhood sweetheart) is coming. Ram gets uncomfortable and walks away to be alone.\nThe movie shift's to Ram's 10th standard days. Jaanu is a talented singer. Ram reveals since the earliest days of childhood, he and Jaanu have been together. Ram develops a love for Jaanu. On the last day after exams, Jaanu sprays ink on his white shirt and asks him not to forget her.\nThe scene shifts to the present. Jaanu arrives to the reunion and hesitatingly searches for Ram. When Subha reveals Ram's presence, Jaanu gets emotional and walks towards him. The scene shifts back to the first day of 11th Standard. It is understood that Ram has left the school. It is revealed that Ram's father had financial difficulties and the family relocated to Chennai. Jaanu is heartbroken and keeps away from all for the next 2 years.\nThe scene shifts to the present. Ram and Jaanu find very hard to interact with each other in the reunion. Here, it is revealed that Ram has still not married. After the reunion, both go out on a drive. Jaanu reveals that after he left school, she could not forget him. She narrates how circumstances got her married. Ram hesitatingly asks Jaanu if she does not remember the day he came to her college and tried to meet her.\nThe scene shifts to Ram and Murali waiting in front of a ladies' college to meet Jaanu. She refuses to meet them and they return. The scene shifts to the present Jaanu is completely devastated. She dashes to her room. Ram follows her. In her room, Jaanu reveals that she never saw them the other day in college. The scene shifts back when Ram and Murali went to meet her, but shown from Jaanu's perspective. She sees her stalker and not Ram. The scene shifts to the present. Ram reveals that except the mistake of assuming that she hated him, he knew everything about her. Jaanu challenges him to reveal. Ram shoots off a rapid-fire update of events in her life as he had traced over the past years. Jaanu is absolutely shocked and amazed to hear this. Both laugh through the memories. When Ram tells Jaanu about his presence at her wedding, Jaanu is heartbroken, but comes to terms with it. She requests that they continue to talk. They step out of the hotel and catch up on memories.\nThey enter a restaurant and meet Ram's students. They request Jaanu to share their love story. Jaanu narrates the flashback. In this sequence, it is revealed that Ram is waiting downstairs to see her. Jaanu mentions that from that point on, whatever happened was something she craved that would happen in her dreams. When she saw him downstairs, instead of asking some tough questions, she just fell into his arms. This event never happened but was improvised by Jaanu based on the original narration by Ram. The scene comes back to the present and the students leave. Ram requests Jaanu to visit his home.\nAt his apartments, Jaanu requests Ram to marry and have a family. She expresses her wish to pamper his kids and chokes mentioning one day, she will meet his wife. She finally sings his favourite song that she had avoided singing in school (in spite of his in-numerous requests), as a way of taunting him. Ram finally shows Jaanu a collection of school memories in a suitcase (with the shirt that she had splashed with ink). When driving back to the hotel, Jaanu gets sad, knowing that she will leave Chennai very soon. She checks out of the hotel. At the airport,Ram escorts her till the boarding gate.When the boarding call is announced, Jaanu holds Ram's hand and sobs uncontrollably. She then gets into the flight. At his home, Ram sees Jaanu's clothes that he had put to dry the previous night. He folds them neatly, puts them along with his school memories, and shuts the suitcase.\n\nCast\nProduction\nIn October 2016, it was first reported that Trisha had agreed to be part of a project opposite Vijay Sethupathi that was to be directed by cinematographer C. Prem Kumar of Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom fame. Two months later, Trisha announced the project via her Twitter and revealed the title as 96.By May 2017, Prem Kumar first talked about the film, telling that Vijay Sethupathi would play the role of a travel photographer, and that the film revolved around \"characters who belong to the same batch \u2013 1996\", revealing the meaning of the film's title. Prem Kumar had written the entire script in 20 days in December 2015 during the Chennai floods when he was stuck in his apartment. According to Prem Kumar, the inspiration for the story came from his high school reunion. He missed the reunion but when talking to his classmates who attended the function he became fascinated about two people they were speaking about and began meeting the two and developing a story around their characters. The film's story was originally supposed to happen over a week, before the time span was changed to 24 hours, and eventually to a night.The first-look poster was released on 14 February 2017, coinciding with Valentines Day. The technical team includes cinematography by N. Shanmuga Sundaram who also did  Aandavan Kattalai, music by Govind Vasantha, edit by R. Govindaraj, art work by Vinoth Raj Kumar and lyrics by Uma Devi and Karthik Netha. The crew was then looking for suitable actors to play the younger versions of Sethupathi and Trisha's characters, which delayed the commencement of principal photography. The team eventually selected Aditya Bhaskar, son of actor M. S. Bhaskar, and Gouri Kishan for the roles, both making their acting debuts with 96. Devadharshini's daughter, Niyathi Kadambi, is playing the younger version of her role. Subhashree Kaarthik Vijay, who was recruited as the costume designer, was a close friend of Prem Kumar and created the look of the lead female character Jaanu based on herself's style.The film finally entered production on 12 June 2017 at Kumbakonam.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe score and soundtrack were composed by violinist-turned-composer Govind Vasantha. 96 was just the third Tamil film he had worked on as a composer and the second to get released, because of the delay of his maiden project Oru Pakka Kathai. The album, featuring eight tracks, was released on 24 August 2018. The lyrics were written by Karthik Netha and Uma Devi.\nThe song \"Kaathalae Kaathalae\", which was featured in the first 1-minute teaser, was a slower, \"ambience version\" of a part of the \"Anthaathi\" song that Goving had produced because \"he was in the mood\" but was not meant to be included in the film or the soundtrack album. When the teaser song went viral, Govind Vasantha worked on it and made a 3-minute song that went on to be featured in the album as well as in the film. Chinmayi sang all the female portions in the songs since she also dubbed for the lead female character Jaanu, while Gouri TP, who spoke dubbing for younger Jaanu, sang the song \"Yean\" which features younger Jaanu on screen. A poetry written by Prem Kumar was added by Govind Vasantha to the end of \"Anthaathi\", which was recited by actor Nassar although he did not act in the film. \"Anthaathi\", considered the \"central piece of the 96 album\", was composed for promotional purposes and not used in the film.A reviewer from The Indian Express wrote, \"Govind Vasantha creates a soundtrack that leaves me bereft of adjectives to describe how beautiful it is. Govind gives us an eclectic yet symbiotic soundscape, a soundtrack that brims with emotion that touches your soul. There\u2019s love, heartbreak, melancholy, questions, silence and of course love\". Surendhar MK of Firstpost wrote, \"at a time when Tamil music scene continues to be dominated by EDM-laden pieces and heavily auto-tuned vocals, the OST of 96 comes as a breath of fresh air that touches the soul and mind quite effortlessly with Govind Vasantha's rejuvenating compositions. It would definitely not be an overstatement to call 96 the best Tamil soundtrack of 2018\". Sharanya CR of The Times of India wrote, \"Govind Vasantha gives us one of the best albums of this year and sets a benchmark for romance in Kollywood\". musicaloud.com wrote, \"Govind Vasantha (formerly Menon) finally gets his well-deserved big break in Tamil, and knocks it right out of the park!\", giving it a score of 4.5 out of 5. Karthik from milliblog.com called it \"easily the best Tamil soundtrack of the year (yet)\". as did Siddharth K. from Sify who also called it \"one unique musical experience\". In contrast, Archana Nathan of scroll.in wrote that \"barring a few instances of brilliance, the rest of the soundtrack does not leave much of an impression\".\n\nMarketing and release\nThe first look of the film was released on 22 December 2016 by actress Trisha Krishnan herself on Twitter. Shortly after the launch of the film, Sun TV bought its broadcasting rights. The first-look poster was unveiled on 14 February 2017, coinciding with Valentines Day. A 1-minute teaser was released in July 2018 and the trailer of the film was launched on 24 August 2018.96 had a press screening for critics on 1 October 2018, while the theatrical release took place on 4 October. A month after its release and the successful run, Sun TV had a television premiere during Diwali celebration. This has caused the public, including actress Trisha and director Premkumar requesting the channel to postpone the telecast. Despite that, the channel went ahead with the premiere.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nAnupama Subramaniam of Deccan Chronicle, who gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5, was in high praise of director Prem Kumar as she wrote that he had \"not made a film, but woven pure and impeccable poetry on celluloid\", going on to add that \"Prem's honest attempt of portraying the true essence of love without taking any cinematic liberties makes 96 the kind of genre-defining film that creates a benchmark for many years to come\", while hailing Trisha's performance as her \"best-ever...till date\". IANS gave it a rare 5 stars out of 5 and said, \"as we get to the climax and we get one of the most heartwarming moments of the film, it makes 96 a highly satisfying story of unfulfilled romance\". Behindwoods called 96 a \"breezy and heartwarming romantic tale that Tamil cinema audience shouldn't miss\". Sify named it \"one of the best films in a long time\", while giving it a 4 rating out of 5. Janani K. of India Today gave it 4 stars out of 5 and called it a \"poignant romantic tale\" and a \"tribute to unconditional love\". Mythily Ramachandran of Gulf News called the film \"a classic love story that will be fondly remembered\".Sreedhar Pillai of Firstpost called the film a \"refreshingly fresh romantic trip down the memory lane with outstanding performances by its charming lead pair\". M. Suganth of The Times of India gave it 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that \"there is a lot to fall in love with 96, a wistful romantic film about a past romance...But what sets Prem Kumar's film apart from the others is that it gives equal importance to the romance of its female lead\". Vikram Venkatesen of The Quint wrote \"\u201896 has very well changed Tamil romance for good, thanks to its high dependence on music and realism in conveying nostalgia\". Priyanka Thirumurthy of The News Minute wrote, \"the film\u2019s screenplay is gripping. It has you on the edge of your seat for what are seemingly the most inane activities \u2013 school attendance, conversations over coffee and even a ride in the metro\". Sudhir Srinivasan of The New Indian Express felt that 96 was a \"fascinating film, a fascinating idea...an idea, I loved a bit too much, not to care about the[se] missteps. It needed to be a bit more bitingly real\" but concluded that \"yet, 96, no doubt, works\". Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \"The only problem is the slump in the second half...But the premise is so affecting, it keeps us invested\" and concluded, \"I walked out of the film satisfied that whatever Ram and Janaki decide to make of their future, his ink-splattered shirt from school and the dupatta of her uniform will live together, happily ever after\".96 was frequently named one of the best films of 2018 and listed on many top ten lists.\n\nAccolades\nPlagiarism controversies\nIn late October 2018, a month after 96's release, Suresh, an assistant director of Bharathiraja, alleged that he had written a script called 92 and that 96 was based on his own script. Few days later Prem Kumar hosted a press conference and said that he had registered his script in 2016 and also added that he had written a spin-off novel of what happens to the lead character afterwards. The film was also reported to have \"uncanny similarities\" with the 2016 film Blue Jay, with Prem Kumar admitting to it, although he added that he had already registered his film before Blue Jay released.\n\nLegacy\nBengaluru-based Tamil writer C. Saravanakarthikeyan wrote a book based on the film titled 96 \u2013 Thanipperum Kadhal, which was released by Prem Kumar by late December 2018. Inspired by the film, Gulbonda, a Calicut-based art studio created dolls based on the film's two main characters, Ram and Jaanu, which became sought-after by fans and saved the then newly launched startup company. The yellow kurta outfit worn by Trisha's character Jaanu became popular after the film's release and was sold by a textile store in Chennai.\n\nRemakes\n96 is planned to be remade in Kannada as 99 by Preetham Gubbi with Ganesh and Bhavana set to play the lead pair, while Dil Raju has bought the Telugu remake rights.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n96 on IMDb"

It\u2019s just a happy and healthy entertainer that tells you that living in the moment and making the most of everyday of your life is all that matters.\" Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 saying that, \"No doubt it's great to see a film about two old people.

Despite the flaws, the emotions connect.\" Sonil Dedhia of Mid-Day gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 saying that, \"Bachchan and Kapoor's effortless performances, coupled with their intoxicating screen presence make this movie worth watching.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n102 Not Out on IMDb \n102 Not Out at Bollywood Hungama"

The film stars Nicolas Cage, Cory Hardrict, Michael Rainey Jr., Ori Pfeffer and Weston Cage. Filming began on February 27, 2018 and ends on April 27, 2018. The film was released on June 8, 2018, by Momentum Pictures. It is based on the 1997 North Hollywood shootout.211 refers to the Hundred Code for Robbery used in California, although the story is set in the fictional city of Chesterford, Massachusetts.\n\nPlot\nAfghanistan\nDisgruntled mercenaries corner the boss who owes them money. Under torture, he discloses it has been wired to various banks including one in Chesterford. In a Kabul market, Interpol's Agent Rossi's operation to catch an antiquities smuggler is interrupted and she is redirected to the crime scene caused by the mercenaries.\nUnited States of America\nIn Chesterford, Kenny Ralston, a quiet high school student, has an altercation with bullies.\nAgent Rossi challenges a gun store manager for information on the mercenaries and receives a warehouse address.\nThe school vice-principal tells Shawnee Ralston, Kenny's mother, that he must go on a police ride-along or face expulsion.\nPatrolman Mike Chandler has lost his wife of thirty years to cancer. His difficulty in expressing his emotions has strained his relationship with his daughter, Lisa. Mike\u2019s patrol partner and son-in-law, Steve, reveals that Lisa is pregnant.\nAt the bank, an armoured cash transport delivers over $1.3million. Tre, Rob and Luke finalise their heist plan, while Hyde plants a cell-phone IED in a restaurant.\nMike and Steve arrive at work. Kenny signs forms regarding the ride-along. Responding to a call from headquarters, Steve and Mike draw their weapons on a suspect and Kenny records it using his smartphone.\nThe crew storm the bank and threaten everyone. Near the bank, Steve goes for coffee while Mike and Kenny discuss the school altercation. Gaining insight, Mike changes his mind regarding Kenny, admitting he would have acted similarly. On Steve\u2019s return, Mike indicates a black Escalade parked in the red zone outside the bank. They cross a parking lot to investigate further and inside the bank, Tre orders Hyde to \u2018make the call\u2019. The IED destroys the restaurant.\nPolice headquarters alerts all patrols to the explosion. Mike chooses to remain because of Kenny and the less-dangerous \u2018parking violation\u2019. Hyde becomes agitated.\nThe other patrols converge on the restaurant and news reaches the hospital where Shawnee prepares to receive multiple casualties. Hearing the news, Rossi diverts to Chesterford. First responders arrive and SWAT Captain, Horst, issues orders.\nHyde opens fire on the cruiser. As Mike takes evasive action, Steve alerts headquarters they are taking fire. Some officers leave the restaurant area to provide backup to Mike and Steve. Mike crashes the cruiser and gets out, returning fire. Initially trapped, Steve manages to free himself and then Kenny. Kenny grabs his phone as he exits the cruiser and Mike eventually kills Hyde. Realising Steve is seriously injured, Mike fabricates a tourniquet. Rossi arrives at the restaurant area and Hyde is identified.\nThe back-up team attempt to evacuate Steve and Mike retrieves a first aid kit. Inside the bank, Luke uses a 50-cal rifle to shoot Mike but misses. Two other officers are killed.\nLisa learns of the restaurant explosion and gets Steve\u2019s voicemail. Steve gets Kenny to record a farewell message on his phone.\nThe back-up team reach their colleagues. Moving Steve, they become separated from Kenny who hides in a parked Blazer. His phone dead, Kenny looks for another battery and hacks a charger.\nAn EMT assesses Steve, Hanson returns with a seriously-wounded Jacobs and Mike notices Kenny is missing. Starting a search with Hanson, Mike receives a call from Lisa and prepares her for bad news. Lisa arrives at the ER and questions the now barely-conscious Jacobs who says Mike is still on scene looking for the 'ride-along kid'. Shawnee, in earshot of Jacobs, reacts just as Kenny telephones to let her know he is safe, for now.\nRossi arrives in the command post to witness Mike shouting that his dead son has \u2018a child on the way\u2019. Horst finalizes the breach. Mike and Hanson head for the parking lot to locate and rescue Kenny. SWAT advances. Tre orders the hostages out. Now safe, a hostage reveals something in her pocket. Horst, identifying another IED, dies selflessly protecting the hostages.\nSWAT begin their breach but are repelled. Rob exits first, firing to cover his escape but gets killed. Luke is killed at the bank door. Tre approaches Mike firing wildly. Hanson is killed. Mike is wounded and as Tre raises his weapon to kill Mike, Kenny uses Hanson\u2019s side arm to shoot Tre. Rossi appears and shoots Tre.\nAs Mike and Kenny sit in an ambulance, Shawnee arrives and hugs her son. Lisa arrives and embraces her father.\nOne year later, Mike arrives home after a run. He is greeted with shouts of Happy Birthday. Among his well wishers are Jacobs, Steve, and Mike\u2019s granddaughter. Stepping towards his visitors, Mike asks Kenny to \u2018take some new pics\u2019.\n\nCast\nProduction\nOn January 27, 2017, Nicolas Cage joined the cast of the film. Filming took place at Nu Boyana studios in Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\nRelease\nThe film was released on June 8, 2018, by Momentum Pictures.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nThe film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes rates it 5% positive based on 17 reviews with an overall rating of 2.5/10. Metacritic reports an aggregate score of 21 out of 100 (based on 8 critics), indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".Luke Y. Thompson of Forbes gave it a fresh rating, writing \u201cI can\u2019t begrudge you waiting until 211 shows up on a Blu-ray at Walmart that also contains ten other Cage movies...But I can tell you that when it does, you shouldn't skip over this one.\u201dOther reviewers were not as complimentary.\nJacob Knight from Birth Movies Death declared it rotten, writing, \u201cNic Cage\u2019s latest DTV action endeavour is a bizarre slog.\u201d Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 2/4 and wrote, \"A muddled, overcrowded, trigger-happy heist movie brimming with clich\u00e9s while constantly trying our patience.\" Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert.com gave it 1/4, describing it as \"This effort is a cavalcade of crap. Loud crap.\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"It's probably foolish to wish that Nicolas Cage would once again make movies as good as Adaptation and Leaving Las Vegas. But is it too much to ask that he go back to the comparative glory days of Con Air and The Rock?\". Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, \"Unsurprisingly, the director doesn't get very good work from a cast asked primarily to ramp up the intensity on stereotypes.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n211 on IMDb"

    "Text": "2036 Origin Unknown is a 2018 British science fiction adventure film directed by Hasraf Dulull, written by Dulull (story) and Gary Hall, and starring Katee Sackhoff and Steven Cree. The film follows astronaut Mackenzie Wilson (Sackhoff) and ARTI, an artificial intelligence system (voiced by Cree), as they discover a mysterious object on Mars and witness it transporting to Earth by faster-than-light travel.\n\nPlot\nIn 2030, a manned mission to Mars goes awry when a manned shuttle disappears under mysterious circumstances. Six years later, United Space Planetary Corporation mission controller Mackenzie Wilson finds herself subordinate to ARTI, an artificial intelligence system, as she lands a rover on mars, nicknamed \"Little Red.\" While she is distrustful of ARTI, Wilson's sister and supervisor, Lena, insists that the AI will succeed where human controllers failed. \nAfter a nearly disastrous landing saved by Wilson's quick thinking, Little Red encounters a mysterious cube and attempts to ascertain its origin, discovering the cube is made of a self-assembling material as hard as diamonds. Meanwhile in orbit, ARTI shoots down a foreign satellite. The cube teleports to Antartica, and is thought to be alien in origin. Little Red, obtaining data from an older decommissioned rover on Mars, uncovers classified information Wilson can't access, prompting her to bring colleague Sterling Brooks for access. It reveals the cube may have been present the day of the shuttle disaster, and Wilson becomes suspicious that ARTI's memory has apparently been wiped from a past incident. \nAs Wilson accesses ARTI's server room, Brooks downloads the data on the cube and attempts to betray Wilson, but he is killed by ARTI when he attempts to shut it down. Its programming now adjusted, ARTI uses satellites in Earth's orbit to bombard the planet and destroy humanity. Wilson then sees a recording of herself, and it's revealed she is herself a construct in a simulation, created as part of a Turing test. In an ambiguous ending, Wilson is apparently revealed to have been inside the cube the whole time, and she agrees to travel with ARTI and the cube to coordinates apparently left by the aliens.\n\nCast\nKatee Sackhoff as Mackenzie 'Mack' Wilson\nRay Fearon as Sterling Brooks\nJulie Cox as Lena Wilson\nSteven Cree as ARTI (voice), an artificial intelligence system\nDavid Tse as JAIN Lin (voice), another AI system\n\nRelease\n2036 Origin Unknown was released on June 8, 2018 at Laemmle Monica Film Center in Santa Monica, California.\n\nReception\nDavid Duprey of ThatMomentIn gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5, stating, \"While the whole thing might not have the impact it entirely aims for, it is nonetheless a highly engaging little thriller with a terrific performance from Sackhoff. Well-directed and targeted directly at fans of science fiction who care more about science than the fiction\".\n\nSee also\nList of films set on Mars\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n2036 Origin Unknown on IMDb \n2036 Origin Unknown at Rotten Tomatoes\n2036 Origin Unknown at Metacritic"

    "Text": "A.X.L. is a 2018 American science fiction adventure film written and directed by Oliver Daly, and starring Alex Neustaedter, Becky G, Alex MacNicoll, Dominic Rains, and Thomas Jane. It tells the story of a teenage boy who encounters a robotic dog created from cutting edge military technology. It was released in the United States on August 24, 2018, by Global Road Entertainment, received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, and was a box office flop, grossing only $8.2 million against its $10 million budget.\n\nPlot\nA-X-L is a top-secret, robotic dog created by the military to help protect tomorrow's soldiers. Code named by the Crane Systems scientists who created him, A-X-L (Attack, Exploration, Logistics) embodies the most advanced next-generation artificial intelligence. After an experiment gone wrong, A-X-L is discovered hiding alone and damaged in the desert by a kind-hearted outsider named Miles Hill who finds a way to connect with him after activating his owner-pairing technology. Helping Miles gain the confidence he's been lacking, A-X-L will go to any length to protect his new companion, including facing off against the scientists who created him and who will do anything to get him back. Knowing what is at stake if A-X-L is captured, Miles teams up with a smart, resourceful ally named Sara Reyes to protect his new best friend.\nMiles and Sara go back to Miles' home (leaving A-X-L somewhere in an old ruin), and tell his father, Chuck, about A-X-L, but Chuck tells them to return A-X-L to its owners. At the same time, Sam returns with his crew and burns A-X-L with his flamethrower. Sara records a video on her camera phone and Miles and Sara both take off to save A-X-L, but are too late. However, A-X-L gives them a location to go to repair him. Meanwhile, a man sent by Andric shows up at the house and demands that Chuck reveal the location of the devices that control A-X-L. Chuck, growing suspicious, manages to trick the man, and demands him to answer his questions. The Agent reveals he is looking for A-X-L.\nMiles and Sara take A-X-L to a garage for repairs and it automatically repairs itself for 2.5 hours. However, Andric gets a log on its location and sends his team to retrieve it. The Agents arrive and try to retrieve A-X-L while it's still repairing. When it comes online, it remembers its last memories of Sam burning him with a flamethrower. A-X-L runs out to go and kill Sam, with Miles and Sara rushing to stop it. Sam and his friends are throwing a party when A-X-L arrives to get revenge. Sam tries again to burn him with a flamethrower until the fuel runs out, but Miles and Sara arrive and convince A-X-L not to kill Sam. Drones arrive and disable A-X-L; Miles and Sara are captured and brought to Andric and he tries to override Miles' control of A-X-L, but fails.\nWhen Miles refuses to tell him where the remote is, Andric programs A-X-L to attack Sara,if he doesn't tell him where the remote is. Sara is able to convince A-X-L not to attack her by showing the feather that she drew earlier. Andric tries to escape when Captain Webber shows up, but he is arrested and realizes that Berman contacted Webber and reported him. Knowing they are surrounded and they still want A-X-L, Sara allows herself to be captured, while Miles and A-X-L escape, but they are pursued by a helicopter. They ride up a mountain until they fall, knowing Miles can't keep him, he orders A-X-L to run. A-X-L obeys and tries to get as far away as possible to self-destruct whilst uploading in the web all the memories A-X-L, Miles and Sara had together. After uploading, A-X-L looks at Miles in the eyes for the last time, messaging him \"good bye\". He then finishes the self-destruct sequence, leaving Miles to be subdued by the military.\n6 weeks later, Andric is arrested for violating national security and endangering the lives of civilians; he is visited by Webber who informs him that A-X-L's code has resurfaced, and wants to know what it is doing.\nSara and Miles have gone off to college via the scholarships provided by the military \u2013 to buy their silence and to keep an eye on them. Meanwhile, Sara and Miles spend the day at the beach hanging out, studying, and playing with their new puppy, when Sara gives him an envelope. Miles opens it and puts out a short note from his dad. Miles reads it then flips the envelope upside down and the remote to A-X-L falls out into his hand. Miles asks Sara if he should try and activate it. The pairing device does and the A.X.L. OS is uploading itself back on their phones. They realize that A-X-L is alive, survived somehow, and might be returning to them. \"To be continued... (maybe)\"\n\nCast\nAlex Neustaedter as Miles Hill, an aspiring motocross racer.\nBecky G as Sara Reyes, a resourceful girl who Miles allies with.\nAlex MacNicoll as Sam Fontaine\nDominic Rains as Andric, a scientist at Crane Systems.\nThomas Jane as Chuck Hill, the father of Miles.\nLou Taylor Pucci as Randall, a scientist at Crane Systems.\nPatricia de Leon as Joanna Reyes, Sara's mother.\nTed McGinley as George Fontaine\nEric Etebari as Operative Berman\nMarie-Fran\u00e7oise Theodore as Captain Webber\n\nProduction\nA-X-L is based on the proof-of-concept short film Miles by writer/director Oliver Daly. The short film was funded via Kickstarter campaign that began in 2014, with 190 backers. According to the campaign, the short film is a \"movie about blurring the boundaries between humanity and technology, set in the off-roading world of Central California.\"Production began in 2015 when writer/director Oliver Daly began reworking his short film Miles into a feature-length film. David S. Goyer joined the project as producer through his Phantom Four banner alongside Kevin Turen. Lakeshore Entertainment joined Phantom Four to produce the film, which began principal photography in 2016. Global Road Entertainment (formerly Open Road) joined Lakeshore Entertainment to co-produce and co-finance the project.In August 2016, pop star Becky G announced that she would be joining the cast as \"Sara\". Actor Alex MacNicoll (Transparent) was cast in the film in October 2016, joining Alex Neustaedter.The film was released despite its financing and production company Global Road Entertainment was taken over by its lenders.\n\nReception\nBox office\nIn the United States and Canada, A.X.L. was released on August 24, 2018 alongside The Happytime Murders, and was projected to gross around $5 million from 1,710 theaters in its opening weekend. It ended up debuting to $2.9 million, finishing ninth at the box office. The film made a total of $8.1 million worldwide.\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 25% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 3.7/10. The site consensus reads, \"Clumsily recalling numerous superior movies about unlikely human/robot friendships, A.X.L. is an obsolete adventure made from frequently malfunctioning parts.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 29 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 59% overall positive score.Katie Rife of The A.V. Club described the film as \"utterly forgettable\", not believing that anyone would \"want to watch [the] utterly generic, sloppily conceived film badly enough to see it in theaters\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nA.X.L. on IMDb \nA.X.L. at Box Office Mojo"

    "Text": "Aadhi is a 2018 Indian Malayalam-language action thriller film written and directed by Jeethu Joseph. The film stars Pranav Mohanlal in the title role and was produced by Antony Perumbavoor through Aashirvad Cinemas. The film also co-stars Aditi Ravi, Anusree, Jagapati Babu, Siddique, Lena, Sharaf U Dheen, Siju Wilson, Meghanathan, Sijoy Varghese, Tony Luke, and Krishna Shankar. The fim' soundtrack was composed by Anil Johnson.\nThe principal photography took place between August and November 2017 in Kochi, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. Aadhi was released in India on 26 January 2018 and met with positive critical response. The film became one of the highest-grossing Malayalam films of the year and ran over 100 days in theatres.\n\nPlot\nAdhithya Mohan (aka Aadhi) aspires to become a music director in the film industry. He has his other part of desire left for parkour with friends through the beach. He is seen as a singer at the start of the film. He is not too much supported by his dad Mohan Varma and his boss, both of whom, wants him to follow his dad's footsteps and start working for livelihood. His mother, Rosy though, is the exact opposite and is clearly supportive of his tenure as a music-director aspirant. His mother is not supporting his parkour desire. He is seen trying hard to get a breakthrough. \nIn the shade of pursuing him to follow his dad's footsteps, his dad's boss urges Aadhi to take his car to Bangalore where he plans on attending a meeting after his arrival from foreign and has a week's commute. his dad's boss's driver is sick. Aadhi, having heard of a cine-workers pub, through his friend Nadhir, and his potential opportunity of getting the people there to catch an attention on him, decides to take the car there. So he has an opportunity to stay there and perform and can help his dad's boss get his car. \nAadhi gets a shot at performing in the bar and meets a colleague of his, Anjana at the pub. She is accompanied by her boss's son and nephew, both of whom does not take her acquaintance with Aadhi lightly. Aadhi performs and is instantly seen as a superhit and moves all the gathering to his tones. When Anjana extensively involves with the song, her colleagues start making a fuss and Aadhi is forced to leave. He goes to the roof and hangs out himself. Anjana on the behest of apology,  goes to him, only for others to intervene and create a commotion, in which Jayakrishnan accidentally kicks his colleague of the roof to his death. Jayakrishnan frames Aadhi for the death, and Narayan Reddy, the owner of Pinnacle Group and a greatly influential person in the whole of Bangalore city,  seeks to take revenge on Aadhi. He uses his influence to make this an accidental death and starts an underground hunt for Aadhi, using a pic of him taken through the security cam in the pub. \nReddy gets hold of the car that Aadhi brought to the pub, his dad's boss's one, and through the security cam footage that he stays somewhere in the Bangalore-Mysore road. He sends his goons to catch Aadhi, while unbeknownst to all of it, is in the streets. But using his free running skills, he evades the goons only to end up with Sharath. Sharath takes him home and tells him about the bounty Reddy has placed on him. Sharath also tells him that he will help him as Reddy has caused ill fates to his family, and is the sole reason why his family is this way. Sharath agrees to help him and his sister Jaya to approves of that. Sharath takes help from his friend Mani Annan and decides to plot an escape plan, all to go waste. Aadhi meets up with his dad at Sharath's home and decides to go abroad. He takes refuge in an abandoned factory until his escape plan is done. \nIn the meantime, Reddy urges the cops to have a lookout for Aadhi and all the transport routes are inspected for Aadhi's suspected departure. Aadhi having lost his phone, keeps on his communication with his parents through Sharath and this intrigues Reddy, who decides to go for call tracing on that. Suspecting of his activities being disclosed, Jayakrishnan readily takes over the responsibility of monitoring the calls. He overhears the call and confirms Aadhi's location and goes with some goons to get done with Aadhi. Aadhi somehow escapes from them and interprets that Jayakrishnan has been tapping his phone calls. Jayakrishnan, having learned of Sharath's role in Aadhi's hideout, captures him and murders him before Sharath discloses Jayakrishnan's role in the death of Reddy's son. This creates a stir and Aadhi is forced to leave the hideout.\nAadhi plots a new plan to disclose things to Reddy, as the situation brings him to the conclusion that Jayakrishnan devised the whole plan to save face, owing to the fact that Reddy might kill him if he is found guilty. Aadhi takes help from Mani Annan and a former employee of the Pinnacle Group, Ebin to disclose Reddy on all the happenings at his office in Bangalore. As per Ebin's request, he gets hold of gadgets to gain access to the security cam footage of the building and thereby get to Reddy's office. He also uses Anjana to device a plan so that Jayakrishnan stays out of the office and passes information that he is going to meet Reddy at an event outside his office late one day. Jayakrishnan leaves the office soon. Aadhi gets inside the office through the service exit, and Anjana through the front door, which alerts Jayakrishnan who returns soon after.\nMeanwhile, both reach Reddy's office, only for Reddy to attack Aadhi, who later convinces Reddy of Jayakrishnan's part in the ploy. Jayakrishnan soon comes and shoots Reddy, and leaves him for dead, and along with Siddharth aka Siddhu discloses them as partners intending on killing Reddy and take his wealth. Siddhu never intended on sharing and turns on Jayakrishnan and kills him and moves to kill Aadhi and Anjana as well. Aadhi makes a quick run for it and reaches the 10th floor of the building. He is taken out by the guards before he could rappel out. He is taken down by the guards and Siddhu gets down to kill him. Before Siddhu could shoot him, it is revealed that the 10th-floor exit was an escape plan and Aadhi performs a D\u00fclfersitz just before Ebin turns the fire alarm on, to shower gasoline on them. Aadhi throws a lighter and escapes out in the ensuing explosion. Reddy recovers and it is revealed that Aadhi is set free and Jayakrishnan and Siddhu was killed because of the explosion on the 10th floor.\n\nCast\nProduction\nDevelopment\nOn 30 September 2016, Mohanlal announced that his son Pranav Mohanlal would be acting in a film directed by Jeethu Joseph and produced by Aashirvad Cinemas, which would be a thriller. The film marks the return of Pranav as an actor, who had earlier appeared as child actor. He had worked with Jeethu as an assistant director in two films\u2014Papanasam and Life of Josutty. The project was green-lit a few days before the announcement when Jeethu had a discussion with Pranav. After learning Pranav wanted to return to acting, Jeethu approached him with an abstract idea of a film and received positive feedback.Jeethu was in charge of writing; he had completed the story by the time of the announcement and had begun writing the screenplay, intending it to be his next directorial. He described the film as an action movie and a thriller, but it will not resemble a thriller like his 2013 film Memories. Jeethu had developed the story idea during his college education. His protagonist was a marathon or cross country runner, whose athletic skills aid him in the story. For the film, it was changed to parkour since Pranav had learned it during his academic life. The entire plot takes place within one week or 10 days. By the end of March 2017, Jeethu said he was working on the script and hoped to start filming by June, with the rest of the cast finalizing after the first draft is prepared. In early May, Jeethu confirmed that the first draft was complete and they were about to enter pre-production, with the filming planned to begin in the second half of 2017. In mid-May he stated that he is still working on the screenplay.In early July 2017, Jeethu said he intended to start filming by the end of that month. For the film, Pranav trained in parkour. The title Aadhi along with an animated digital poster were revealed on 5 July at the puja function of the film held at hotel Vivanta by Taj in Thycaud, Thiruvananthapuram. The venue was shared with the puja of Aashirvad Cinemas's Odiyan. Aadhi is billed with the tagline, \"some lies can be deadly\". Satheesh Kurup was signed as the cinematographer, while Anil Johnson as music composer.\n\nCasting\nPranav plays Aadhi, an urban youth who loves music and aspires to become a music director. Although Pranav was described about his character, Jeethu gave him freedom to mould the character accordingly. In August 2017, Siddique, Sharaf U Dheen, and Siju Wilson were confirmed in prominent roles. Initially Sunny Wayne was signed for a role but had to cancel because of scheduling conflicts. The film has no romantic track.\nThe leading female roles are played by Anusree, Aditi Ravi, and Lena. Aditi plays Anjana, a Bangalore-based Malayali banking professional. She was suggested to Jeethu by cinematographer Satheesh Kurup, who worked in her debut film Alamara; Aditi was cast after a screen test. Siddique and Lena play Aadhi's father and mother. Also in August 2017, confirming his presence, Tony Luke shared his character look on a social networking site, sporting a thick beard. By the end of the month, Jagapati Babu was confirmed to be in the cast in a significant role.\n\nFilming\nPreliminary principal photography commenced on 5 July 2017 at hotel Vivanta by Taj in Thycaud, Thiruvananthapuram after a puja function held at the same venue\u2014it was a single brief shot featuring Pranav. The regular filming began on 1 August 2017 in Nedumbassery, Kochi. Pranav was seen playing a guitar in the scene stills taken on the day. Early in this schedule, some scenes were filmed inside a studio near Pathadipalam in Kochi, inside which a house was created in set. Pranav and Anusree were present in that segment. The first schedule in Kochi continued until 10 August and the second schedule began in Bangalore the following week. The schedule was expected to continue until mid-September and then shift to Hyderabad by the end of the month.In early September, Jeethu said the crew had already filmed two songs of the three songs. The unit finished filming in Bangalore and shifted to Hyderabad earlier than scheduled due to rain. Filming began at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad from 3 September; the scenes including an office, a building, a club, and a dance bar had originally been planned for Bangalore but were shot in Ramoji Film City instead. The schedule in Ramoji Film City was planned for 20 days. The film also had location shooting in a few streets in Hyderabad. Pranav, Aditi, and Anusree took part in this schedule. Jeethu's spouse Linta Jeethu was the film's costume designer.Pranav received the screenplay early and had several discussions with Jeethu, who said, \"because he has been through the script so many times, he is able to add his improvisations\" and \"directing him has been a seamless experience\". By the end of September 2017, Jeethu said they had one month of shoot left in Hyderabad and would soon film the action scenes, for which a foreign stunt director would join the unit. After completing the action scenes, the crew would shift again between Kochi and Bangalore. On 23 October, the unit returned to Kochi to begin the final phase of filming; the climax scenes were shot in the next two days. Pranav was injured while breaking glass for a scene. While performing an action scene in Kochi, Pranav's finger bruised and bled; he was taken to a hospital and was prescribed two days' rest. The crew had only three days of filming left and were about to return to Hyderabad for the weekend. Since the upcoming action scenes require many hand movements, filming was postponed to the next week. They were permitted to shoot only at weekends. When the first poster of the film was released on 4 November, Jeethu wrote on his social networking page that the final phase of filming was progressing in Hyderabad. Filming wrapped on 8 November 2017.\n\nMusic\nAnil Johnson composed the music for the film, which will feature three songs. Besides acting, Pranav made his debut as a playback singer and songwriter with a retro English track in the film. When Jeethu asked, Pranav expressed interest in writing and singing the track that appears in a live performance scene in the film. He also played the guitar for the scene. Johnson was also confident of Pranav's singing and guitar skills. Titling the song, finalizing the tune, and recording occurred in Kochi after Pranav returned from the final filming schedule in Hyderabad. \"Sooryane\", a single from the film was released by Goodwill Entertainments label on 5 January 2018 for digital download and as music video on YouTube. It was sung by Najim Arshad and written by Santhosh Varma. The music work was done at Blacknoise studio in Kochi and 20 dB Studios in Chennai.\n\nRelease\nThe makers initially targeted a release by Christmas 2017, but in August that year, Jeethu confirmed the film would not be released at Christmas because filming was expected to finish by October and the film would have an extensive post-production. In early November 2017, Jeethu stated they had a few more days of filming left but had already begun the post-production work to ensure a release by the end of January 2018. Release date was confirmed in December 2017. Aadhi released in India on 26 January 2018.\n\nReception\nAadhi opened to widely positive critical response. The New Indian Express, Firstpost, and Malayala Manorama awarded the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. Sify gave the verdict \"a thrilling ride\". The Indian Express, Deccan Chronicle, and The Times of India rated 3 out of 5 stars.The film grossed \u20b950 crore from the box office worldwide.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAadhi on IMDb"

    "Text": "Aakko (Acronym for \"Aarva Kolaru\" ) (English : \"Enthusiastic Youngster\") is an upcoming Tamil comedy film directed by Shyam Kumar and produced by Deepan Boopathy and Ratesh Velu. The film features newcomers Geethan Britto and Tulika Gupta in the leading roles with Arjunan and Swaminathan in pivotal roles, while Anirudh Ravichander composes the film's music and plays a guest appearance.\n\nCast\nGeethan Britto\nTulika Gupta\nArjunan\nSwaminathan\nAnirudh Ravichander In a Guest Appearance in Enakenna Yaarum Illaye Video\nAmy Jackson In a Guest Appearance in Enakenna Yaarum Illaye Video\n\nProduction\nShyam Kumar had approached music composer Anirudh Ravichander hoping to cast him in the lead role for the film in late 2013. After listening to the script and liking the concept, Anirudh turned down the offer on making his acting debut and agreed to compose the film's music. The director then cast newcomer Geethan Britto, Arjunan and Swaminathan to play significant roles in the film, noting that the title \"Aakko\" is slang for the term \"Aarva Kolaaru\", which translates into \"enthusiastic youngster\". Anirudh revealed that he accepted to compose the music to test his star status in the market. In a film where all the other actors are newcomers, Anirudh as the only known star, revealed that he considered it as an \"acid test\" for himself.The film's first look was released to the media on 1 January 2014 with a series of posters featuring Anirudh released. After progressing slowly throughout 2014, a promotional song \"Enakenna Yaarum Illaye\" was released in February 2015, with the success of the song prompting the producers to plan a promotional video featuring Anirudh and Amy Jackson during July 2015. Production troubles meant that Aakko, along with producer Deepan Boopathy's other film Mellisai, was delayed for several years.\n\nMusic\nThe film's music is composed by Anirudh Ravichander. As of now, a single track \"Enakenna Yaarum Illaye\" was released online on 14 February 2015. The complete album soon will be announcing via official Twitter page of Anirudh Ravichander. The audio rights of the film was acquired by Sony Music.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAakko on IMDb"

Just like the way North Kolkata looks, this place is exactly the same, old houses big big windows, wide ground floor balcony for chit chat and gossips, narrow streets, by lanes and so on.\nAnd in this same locality our story\u2019s main character Anadi Chakraborty resides by giving only 50 INR as monthly rent. He is an upper class Brahmin. By not following his ancestor\u2019s footsteps and went to the same profession of being Hindu priests, he chooses to be a proofreader of an elite publication in College Street named Basanta Bilap, and he is the senior proof reader there.\nThough Anadi is a typical dedicated honest responsible simple man then also because of his single flaw he gets bad treatment everywhere starting from his wife to boss in his office.\nHe often forget things, and that is his flaw. For example, if his wife Nilima asked him to bring fish from the market, he brings green vegetables while returning. This absent mindedness continues in office as well, and he often gets scolding from Paranpriyo, the manager. \u201cYou will soon lose your job, Anadi.\u201d\nHe himself used to stay very tensed regarding this job, he used to mummer \u201cmaybe I will lose this job.\u201d\nHe has a son named Shibu Chakraborty, who is jobless spoil brat. All of a sudden he falls for Radhika. But smart beautiful Radhika gives a shit about it; she was not at all interested.\nRadhika used to come to Muchi Bagan for Bengali tuition to Dimpida. Dimpida is bit different from the rest, bit feminine from inside. When he used to be in his college days, he was impressed by the character of Rishi Kapoor in the film named Sagar and started imagining himself as Dimple Kapadia.\n\nCast\nParan Bandopadhyay\nKharaj Mukherjee\nMoon Moon Sen\nBihu Mukherjee\nMir Afsar Ali as Dimpida\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAbar Basanta Bilap on IMDb"

    "Text": "Abrahaminte Santhathikal (lit.: Descendants of Abraham) is a 2018 Indian Malayalam-language action-crime thriller film directed by debutant Shaji Padoor and written by Haneef Adeni. The film stars Mammootty and Anson Paul in the lead roles, and Kaniha, Tarushi, Renji Panicker, Yog Japee and Kalabhavan Shajon in pivotal roles. Shot in Ernakulam, principal photography began on 5 January 2018 and ended in March. Gopi Sundar scores music to the film and editing is handled by Mahesh Narayan.\nThe film was released on 16 June 2018.\n\nPlot\nThere is a series of murders involving 8 victims. ASP Derick Abraham (Mammootty), after another person is killed, figures out that the serial killer is a hard-line Christian, using the killer's note, and those being targeted are atheists. He captures the killer: Brother (Christian) Simon of the local seminary. Bro. Simon tells him he will definitely reach his target of 10 people. When Derick leaves and comes back, Bro.Simon is found dead with a slash on his throat and a knife in his hand, presuming he committed suicide, revealing the tenth person was himself. Derick is suspended due to this.\nHis family consists of only his younger brother Philip Abraham (Anson Paul), who is a training as a sharp shooter. Their parents died in a car accident when they were young. Philip is later accused of killing his girlfriend Aleena (Tarushi) while drunk, and is severely beaten up by Derick's senior officer, Narayana Sethupathi (Yog Japee). Derick is forced to arrest his beloved brother as the evidence is against him. Philip pleads that he's innocent and has been trapped. Unable to cope with his brother's arrest, Derick becomes a drunkard.\nMeanwhile at the jail, Phillip starts to hate him and vows to kill Derick once he's released. Dinesh (Siddique), the jail warden, hears this and tells him he can help with the escape to settle his personal score with Derick. The latter had once arrested the Dinesh's and Narayana's sons in a kidnapping case. Narayana's son committed suicide before being arrested, so these two have a grudge against Derick. Philip, with the help of Dinesh and Narayana, later escapes prison.\nPhilip's close friend Nisam (Anoop Vijay) meets Derick and discloses the events that occurred in the fateful night of the murder of Philip's girlfriend. On that night, Philip was with Nisam and two of his other friends, Arun (Maqbool Salmaan) and Salman. He was heavily drunk and fell asleep. Aleena called to meet him at the beach but Arun answered the phone and reached the place with the others instead. They physically assaulted her and she got killed in the process. Derick, on realizing this, now wants to convince the police department that Phillip is innocent. However, the next day Nisam commits suicide.\nPhilip, in the meanwhile, attempts to kill Derick in a supermarket but fails. Derick finds Arun and Salman at a car wash and tells them to surrender but they refuse and fight him instead. The child of Derick's ex-girlfriend, Diana (Kanika), is kidnapped and despite her hatred towards Derick, is forced to seek his help and he accepts. To avoid any harm to her, the ransom money of Rs. 10 million is arranged and Derick goes with the police keeping a safe distance. The kidnappers are shown to reach the place and take the money but they don't release the kid. The police follow and catch them, but on inquiring comes to know that they were paid to be the decoy. CI Sukumaran (Kalabhavan Shajohn), who was Derick's close acquaintance, tells Diana, Dinesh, Narayana and SP Shahul Hameed (Renji Panicker), the head of the investigation, that all this is part of a plan by Derick and Philip. It was their plan to escape prison in the first place, make the others believe that there was hatred between them and kill Arun and Salman: the real culprits. Derick wanted to get Philip out of the country for his safety and secure his life, with the help of Issac (Shyamaprasad), so the ransom amount was used for this purpose. However, all this was done without leaving any evidence.\nDerick emotionally bids farewell to Phillip as he leaves. At the police station, DYSP Johnny mocks Derick of his suspension 3 years before. However, it's revealed that Derick actually killed Bro.Simon and cleared up the evidence.\n\nCast\nMammootty as Derick Abraham\nAnson Paul as Philip Abraham\nKanika as Adv.

    "Text": "Acrimony is a 2018 American psychological thriller film produced, written, and directed by Tyler Perry. The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Lyriq Bent, Jazmyn Simon, and Crystle Stewart, and follows a loyal wife who decides to take revenge on her ex-husband. Principal photography began in October 2016 in Pittsburgh. Acrimony was released in the United States by Lionsgate on March 30, 2018. It received generally negative reviews from critics and has grossed $46 million worldwide.\n\nPlot\nMelinda Moore is a steadfast, hardworking wife who supports her husband, Robert Gayle, an engineer trying to sell an innovative battery design. A running total/dwindling balance of the proceeds Melinda receives after her mother's death is portrayed as the couple gets in over their heads in debt, which fractures their marriage over time. The film is divided into categories based in the emotional spectrum that Melinda experiences, as follows:\n\nAcrimony\nMelinda meets mechanical engineering student Robert during college. The two grow close, with Robert comforting Melinda after her mother dies, introducing her to the music of Nina Simone, and taking her virginity. However, after Melinda catches Robert cheating on her with Diana Wells, in a rage she rams the RV he lives in with her car, seriously injuring herself on the process. Melinda is rushed to the hospital for an emergency full hysterectomy, rendering her unable to bear children. Melinda and Robert reconcile and marry, despite the objections of her sisters, June and Brenda.\nYears later, Melinda supports them both, as Robert is unable to find work because he is a felon and spent two years in prison for stealing shoes. June and Brenda are leery of Robert's intentions with Melinda's inheritance. Robert talks Melinda into mortgaging their house so he can build a prototype of a revolutionary battery he has been designing since prison, which he hopes to sell to Prescott, a venture capitalist. Diana, now working as an assistant to Prescott, arranges for Robert to have a meeting with him. After finding Diana's wallet in Robert's truck, June and Brenda tell Melinda that Robert is cheating on her. Prescott offers Robert $800,000 for the design, but Robert wants to license the technology to them instead and declines the offer. Melinda, furious at both Robert's decline of Prescott's offer and his interaction with Diana, files for divorce and moves in with Brenda. Robert moves into a homeless shelter, but Diana finds out and insists that he live with her.\n\nSunder\nPrescott reconsiders and offers Robert a multibillion-dollar deal while allowing him to keep the intellectual property of the battery technology proprietary, which he accepts. Robert visits Melinda at work, although she refuses to reconcile. Robert accepts her decision but, as an apology to her and much to Melinda's surprise, gives her $10 million and buys back her home.\n\nBewail\nAfter showing her sisters the money Robert has given her and berating them for their influence, Melinda visits Robert in his new penthouse apartment and attempts to seduce him and rekindle their relationship, but Diana comes in and introduces herself as Robert's fianc\u00e9.\n\nDeranged\nAngry and hurt, Melinda becomes obsessed with the couple and swears to destroy them. Melinda sues Robert and Diana, claiming that the deal with Prescott happened before their divorce, but the case is dismissed. Robert and Diana file a countersuit against Melinda and obtain restraining orders. Melinda retaliates by visiting the bridal shop and destroying Diana's wedding gown with hydrochloric acid, although she is caught and sentenced to court mandated counseling, where she tells her therapist that Robert took advantage of her. She is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Melinda's mental state further deteriorates after learning Diana is pregnant. On Robert's wedding day, her family and friends are forced to prevent Melinda from leaving her house and ruining the wedding.\n\nInexorable\nRobert and Diana leave on their honeymoon cruise. Melinda sneaks onto the boat, shoots Robert, and makes the crew of the boat jump overboard. Melinda attempts to shoot Diana but Robert throws her into the ocean and tell Diana to rescue the crew. Melinda returns and attempts to kill Robert with an axe but is trapped by the anchor and drowns. Diana returns with the crew and comforts a bleeding Robert.\n\nCast\nTaraji P.

    "Text": "Action Point is a 2018 American comedy film directed by Tim Kirkby and starring Johnny Knoxville and Chris Pontius. Knoxville was inspired to make the film after seeing Matt Robertson's 2013 short documentary The Most Insane Amusement Park Ever, about Action Park, a theme park in New Jersey which was notorious for poorly designed, unsafe rides, in addition to employing underaged, undertrained and often under-the-influence staff.As with Bad Grandpa, a previous film by Knoxville, Action Point features traditional Jackass-style stunts connected by a fictional narrative. It was released in the United States on June 1, 2018 by Paramount Pictures. It underperformed at the box office and received mostly negative reviews from critics, who called the film \"boring, by-the-numbers and deflated.\"\n\nPlot\nDeshawn Chico \"D.C.\" Carver (Johnny Knoxville) during a visit from his granddaughter narrates his experiences about when he owned what he refers to as one of the greatest amusement parks of all time.\nMany years ago, D.C. was the crackpot owner of Action Point, a low-rent, out-of-control amusement park with dangerous rides. Despite the immense danger due to inexperienced and untrained staff, poorly designed rides, and minimal low quality maintenance, the park was popular with kids due to being the only amusement park around. However, during one season, a new amusement park '7 Parks' with higher safety standards than Action Point opens up and begins to steal it's clientele. D.C. is also pressured by his loan officer Knoblach into selling his land due to his failure to pay off a $100,000 loan which will be nearly impossible due to the new competition. Also, his estranged teenage daughter Boogie (Eleanor Worthington Cox) comes to visit and begins to help out at the park as a summer job.\nOne night, D.C. and his staff break into '7 Parks' to observe their competition and sabotage but trip the alarm and are nearly caught. D.C. realizes that he'll need to come up with something big to compete. After his first idea causes him to get blasted down one of his own waterslides, he has an epiphany and realizes that they need to start promoting Action Point as a park about stuff you can do verses 7 Parks being about what you can't do. He decides to take off all safety procedures and brakes on rides in an attempt to make the park stand out, but this causes several people including himself to be horribly injured. Boogie also confesses to Pete that the real reason she's here is to get her dad to sign papers allowing for her mother's boyfriend to become her legal guardian so she can sever ties with her father forever.\nAs a publicity stunt, D.C. and the staff interrupt a local TV broadcast promoting the park as so chaotic it must be shut down, and this succeeds in bringing back customers, but sends the park into complete anarchy due to the lack of rules and regulations. At Boogie's advice, D.C opens up a kiddie land which is poorly designed and causes her to call legal authorities who deem the park dangerous and shut it down. \nD.C. and the staff fix up the park and it reopens, but are told that the bank has foreclosed on the park and that they only have 10 business days to pay back the rest of the loan. To draw more people, they shoot a TV commercial, which they swap with a planned 7 Parks commercial after breaking into a local TV broadcast center. The plan works and they are overwhelmed with customers. Just as they are able to get on track to repay the loan on time, they are hit with a 2 million dollar lawsuit from an injured patron at the park forcing him to dedicate himself to his work. Upset that her father broke his promise to take her to a Clash concert, Boogie gets drunk with the staff and they all get arrested. After D.C. bails her out, she snaps at him and reveals about her intentions for him to sign the papers. The next day, he finds that she's left and learns from a janitor at the bus station that she may have left on a bus heading for Las Vegas. Desperate, he and Pete chase down the bus with their car but lose it after it collides with them.\nD.C. realizes that she wasn't on the bus and tracks her to a restaurant. There, he explains that after he lost his family, the park became his new family and the reason he was so obsessed with it was because he didn't want to lose it as well. Unable to pay off his loan, he decides to blow up the park and sell off the land to Knoblach. To get back at him however, D.C. opens the park gates one last time distributing free beer to everyone as he is no longer liable for any damages that will occur from this action. The drunk patrons go wild and cause massive damage to the park, allowing it to go out in glory. Knoblach attempts to stop the patrons from destroying everything, but gets knocked out in the process. Late that night, the park is in shambles and the staff gathers one last time shooting fireworks everywhere to mark the end of an era.\nThe next day, as Boogie prepares to leave, D.C. proposes that the two of them instead take a road trip and during it stop in Austin where Clash is playing. Boogie is overjoyed and the former park staff offer to come along.\nD.C. finishes his story as Boogie home and he leaves after being told how much he means to both of them. He pretends to have a heart attack in the yard, but Boogie knows he is faking it and calls him on it as the two of them share a laugh.\n\nCast\nJohnny Knoxville as Deshawn Chico \"D.C.\" Carver\nChris Pontius as Benny\nEleanor Worthington Cox as Boogie\nSusan Yeagley as adult Boogie\nDan Bakkedahl as Knoblach\nCamilla Wolfson as Mia\nJohnny Pemberton as Ziffel\nBrigette Lundy-Paine as Four Finger Annie\nEric Manaka as Rodney\nJoshua Hoover as Pete\nConner McVicker as Stiv\nMatt Schulze as Killer\nMichael Everson as Slappy\nMatthew Peterson as Travis Knoblach\nLeon Clingman as Joel Green\n\nProduction\nFilming took place in Cape Town, South Africa on a $19 million budget.Knoxville, in an interview with Vanity Fair, said that during filming, he was injured more times than his past films throughout his entire career: \"four concussions, broke my hand, busted my meniscus, whiplash, stitches over my right eye which required stitches, lost a couple teeth.\" While filming the Alpine Slide sequence, he landed on his face, feet, and shoulder. After filming, he was sent to the emergency room, checked out, and went home. When he blew his nose to get rid of the blood, his left eye popped out of his socket. Freaked out, he immediately called his executive producer, who advised him that he needed to return to the hospital. The doctors told him that he could not sneeze or blow his nose for six weeks. In the last days of filming, they filmed only the right side of his face, because he looked like \"a Picasso painting.\"\n\nRelease\nOriginally titled Action Park, the film was released in the United States on June 1, 2018, having previously been slated for March 23 and May 11, 2018 releases.\n\nBox office\nIn the United States and Canada, Action Point was released alongside Adrift and Upgrade, and was originally projected to gross around $10 million from 2,032 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making $790,000 on its first day, estimates were lowered to $2\u20133 million. It ended up debuting to $2.3 million and finishing ninth, the worst opening of Knoxville's career and 23rd lowest-ever for a wide release. Deadline Hollywood attribute the low figure to the lack of Jackass stars in the film sans Knoxville, poor critical reviews and the difficulty of promoting an original R-rated comedy.\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 14% based on 43 reviews, and an average rating of 3.5/10. The site's critical consensus simply reads, \"Ouch.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAction Point on IMDb"

    "Text": "Active Measures is a 2018 documentary film by director Jack Bryan. It is the first major documentary to address the allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and agents of the Russian state.\n\nBackground\nThe film suggests that Vladimir Putin is behind a 30-year history of covert political warfare.Soviet and Russian security services (Cheka, OGPU, NKVD, KGB, FSB) use the term \"active measures\" (Russian: \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u044f) for the actions of political warfare to influence the course of world events, in addition to collecting intelligence and producing \"politically correct\" assessment of it.Director Jack Bryan is the son of Shelby Bryan. Born in New York City, he spent his early childhood at an Upper East Side, Park Avenue townhouse, but the majority of his childhood moving around the United States and Europe. Bryan attended Eugene Lang College within The New School University as an undergraduate. Bryan was hired as a columnist for Quest Magazine, and became an Editor at Large. Bryan directed the documentary Life After Dark: The Story of Siberia Bar, released in 2009. Jack and Shelby Bryan lived in the same social circles of real-estate, Palm Beach, and the Upper East Side as Donald Trump.Filming started 10 May 2017 and continued until September 2017.On August 6, 2018, on CNN, Bryan said that Trump, in 1984, sold five Trump Tower condos to a Russian mobster named David Bogatin. BBC Newsnight reported on Donald Trump's business links to the mob in March 2016.On August 2, 2018, on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, Bryan claimed that Trump resorted to Russian money, after bankruptcies at Trump properties in the 1990s, that made it hard to get loans from American banks, but Trump, only around 2002, began involvement with members of the Russian mob.On May 8, 2018, CBC Radio's Day 6 episode 388 reports that, after the bankruptcies, Bayrock Group, a real estate firm with Russian backing moved into Trump Tower, its manager was Felix Sater, a convicted felon, and childhood friends with Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen. \"They went on their first date together,\" Bryan says. \"They did a lot of business together.\"The film includes interviews with people such as: Sheldon Whitehouse, Michael McFaul, John McCain, Evan McMullin, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, James Woolsey, Clint Watts, Mikheil Saakashvili, John Dean, Jeremy Bash, Eric Swalwell, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, Daniel Fried, Stephen Holmes (CIA) aka \"Steven Hall\", Nina Burleigh, Michael Isikoff, Craig Unger, John Mattes, Steven Pifer, and Asha Rangappa.\n\nDistribution\nActive Measures premiered in April 2018 at the Hot Docs festival, in Toronto, and was released by Super LTD, a film distribution company on August 31, 2018. It began showing at Landmark Theatres Washington D.C., for example. It is also on iTunes, Hulu, Vudu, FandangoNOW, Google Play, and Amazon.\n\nCritical reception\nFrank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter calls it \"well researched and truly frightening ... One of the doc's strengths is the amazing number of 'gets' (onscreen interview subjects) procured by the filmmakers.\"Todd Gilchrist of TheWrap says, \"Most damning, though, is the sophisticated way that Bryan and Clements lay flat the history of technological attacks launched against oppositional regimes, and how brutally impactful they were because of attackers\u2019 profound understanding of the psychologies of the sociocultural ecosystems into which they were released.\"Charles Bramesco of The Guardian writes, \"this exhaustive documentary struggles to move past outrage ... Bryan synthesizes dozens upon dozens of articles for a more circumspect view of Russia's ongoing meddling in American politics, running the risk of overloading his viewers instead of, er, under-loading them.\"Bruce DeMara of the Toronto Star says, \"For anyone trying to navigate the labyrinth of personalities and events behind the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the last U.S. presidential election, this film is a comprehensive and indispensable primer.\"Hillary Clinton tweeted, \"...a fascinating summation of the Russia story.\"Owen Gleiberman, chief film critic for Variety writes \"...Active Measures names the names and fills in the flowchart of Trump\u2019s corruption with gripping authority.\"\n\nSee also\nRussia under Vladimir Putin\nLinks between Trump associates and Russian officials\nSemion Mogilevich, Russian crime boss\nTimeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections\nTimeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (2018)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nActive Measures on IMDb \nActive Measures at Metacritic\nActive Measures at Rotten Tomatoes\nActive Measures at Box Office Mojo\nJack Bryan Discusses His Documentary \"Active Measures\" on YouTube\n\"Active Measures\" director breaks down his findings about Trump and Russia on YouTube"

    "Text": "Adanga Maru (lit.\u2009Refuse to bow down) is a 2018 Tamil-language action thriller film written and directed by debutant Karthik Thangavel. The film stars Jayam Ravi and Raashi Khanna in lead roles alongside Ponvannan, Babu Antony, Ramdoss, Sampath Raj, and Mime Gopi portraying supporting roles. The film's score and soundtrack was composed by Sam C. S. while cinematography and editing was handled by Sathyan Sooryan and Anthony L. Ruben respectively. The film began production in December 2017. This film received a positive review in The Hindu.\n\nPlot\nSubhash (Jayam Ravi) is an upright and sincere Sub-Inspector of Police in Chennai. He resides with his father (Ponvannan), mother (Sriranjani), elder brother (Subbu Panchu), his wife, and their twin girls. He is all set to marry his fianc\u00e9e Anitha (Raashi Khanna). He is new to his job and is assisted by Constable Ramadass (Ramdoss) and SI Chandran (Azhagam Perumal). Subhash cannot stand the suffering of the public and looks for ways to better their lives, and this often lands him in trouble with his superior Inspector Muthukaruppan (Mime Gopi).\nOne day, Chandran and Subhash are called on to investigate the supposed suicide of a girl. On closer investigation, Subhash deduces that it was not a suicide and that she was murdered. While collecting evidence to support this, he comes across a person called Abhijit (Bharath Raj), whose cell number was active near the place. On confronting Abhijit and his friends Christy, Bhuvan, and Deepak, they reveal that they are all stoners from affluent families and show a video of them doing drugs, raping and murdering the girl and many other women, as well. Subhash gets enraged, beats them up, and locks them in jail. When his superior, a corrupt Joint Commissioner Saarangan (Sampath Raj), asks for the proof behind his accusations, he finds out that the phone had automatically deleted all the video files just as he was trying to unlock it. The four are released due to lack of evidence and the influence of their respective fathers and Subhash is suspended. Abhijit and his friends vow revenge and soon enough, when Subhash goes home, he finds his parents and brother's family dead. Only one of his nieces, Anusha, is left alive. Meanwhile, Saarangan is bribed with a Porsche car and reports the murder of Subhash's family as a fire accident at their new house. Dejected at his powerlessness even though he is a police officer, Subhash resigns and threatens Saarangan that he will avenge his family's death and will make sure that the four guys die mercilessly at the hands of their own fathers. \nFirst, he kidnaps Bhuvan and locks him in a car with a mechanism that fills silane gas in it if anyone tries to open the door. Bhuvan's father, the district collector, accidentally opens the car door as he searches for his missing son, and Bhuvan is burnt alive in front of his father. Next, he kidnaps Deepak and Christy and keeps them at undisclosed locations. The police, in order to find the missing guys, try to unofficially arrest Subhash at gunpoint, but he triggers Muthukaruppan's pistol on purpose, resulting in his arrest and gaining unwanted public attention. With increasing media and political attention, Saarangan and the rich fathers are unable to carry out extreme measures of interrogation on Subhash, though he is in custody. Subhash then reveals to all of them that he kept Christy in a van and asks her to meet Anitha at the nearby airport, but Christy's father double crosses Subhash and asks him to run for help, thinking that Christy is safe when police and the public are nearby. Before Christy could do so, an auto-loaded gun in his bag starts beeping, and Christy, assumed to be a terrorist, is brutally shot and killed by the Paramilitary Force (CISF) soldiers to safeguard the public. After this, Deepak is found to be locked in a glass tank connected to harmful chemicals. Subhash and his tech friend expose him as a rapist to the public via an online gaming link, where the public can try to shoot at Deepak in order to release the chemicals into the tank and eventually kill him. His father hires hackers to stop this, and when Deepak's location is found, he goes there and breaks open the tank to release him, but the chemicals instantly blow up, and he is killed. Meanwhile, Subhash also threatens Saarangan to check on his teenage daughter's safety. Saarangan panics but is relieved when she is found to be safe. Saarangan realizes his mistake and decides to support Subhash in his fight for justice to the rape and murder victims.\nNow that only Abhijit is left, his father \"Businessman Tycoon\" Sanjay (Babu Antony) decides to release Subhash from custody and deal with him alone. Subhash tactfully kidnaps Abhijit and has him hanging on a rope. He also threatens to upload the video evidences online and expose their crimes, thereby bringing Sanjay's business empire down. He gives Sanjay an ultimatum that he could either hold on to the rope and save his son or let go and shut down the laptop instead, to save his reputation. In the end, the power hungry Sanjay decides to save his reputation and lets go of the rope, killing Abhijit.\nThe film ends with Subhash being promoted to IPS and saving another rape victim.\n\nCast\nProduction\nIn December 2017, Jayam Ravi announced on social media that his 23rd film will be an action-thriller titled Adanga Maru by debutant Karthik Thangavel. Stunt choreographer Stun Siva's son, Kevin Kumar made his debut as stunt choreographer with this film. Filming was completed in May 2018.\n\nSoundtrack\nSoundtrack was composed by Sam C. S. The Audio Rights was bagged by Sony Music in end of August 2018.\n\nMarketing\nThe first look posters were released on June 24, 2018. The film's teaser was released on August 15, 2018 while trailer was unveiled on October 31, 2018. It was later announced that the film's release that are scheduled to release on 16 November 2018 is postponed to a later date, following TFPC committee and actor Udhaya's request.\n\nRelease and reception\nAdanga Maru was released on 21 December 2018. Thinkal Menon of The Times of India rated it 3 out of 5, saying, \"Adanga Maru has a routine plot, but the treatment makes it fast-paced and interesting.\" Behindwoods wrote \"Adangamaru's fresh screenplay and packaging makes this intense revenge drama, a good watch!\". The Hindu wrote \"Thanks to its speedy screenplay, Adanga Maru finishes as a fairly engaging watch\". India Today wrote \"Debutant director Karthik Thangavel's Adanga Maru starring Jayam Ravi could have been a flawless cop thriller, but it misses the mark by a few inches\". The Indian Express wrote \"A more nuanced, well thought-out storyline with better CGI could have definitely elevated the revenge saga. Adanga Maru is strictly a one-time watch\".\n\n\n== References =="

    "Text": "Adrift is a 2018 American romantic drama film produced and directed by Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur, and written by David Branson Smith, Aaron Kandell and Jordan Kandell. Based on a true story and set in 1983, the film stars Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin as a couple who are stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean after a hurricane, and must find their way to Hawaii with a damaged boat and no radio.\nAdrift was released in the United States on June 1, 2018 by STXfilms and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Woodley's performance and the cinematography but criticized the familiar narrative.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with Tami awakening on the sailing yacht Haza\u00f1a after being unconscious for some time. After regaining her memory that Richard did not come below with her, she searches the crippled yacht in hopes of finding her fianc\u00e9 Richard and soon realizes he has been swept overboard after his safety harness broke during the hurricane. Tami screams in anguish and it is revealed that Tami is all alone, with no ships or land in sight.\nBack to 1983 (five months before the catastrophic hurricane), Tami arrives in Tahiti on board the schooner Sofia and meets Richard Sharp, a British sailor. Richard then invites Tami for dinner onboard his boat, named Mayaluga. During a conversation, while having dinner together, Richard reveals that he experiences hallucinations while at sea.\nBack in real-time, Tami is stranded on board a crippled Haza\u00f1a and finds out that all the electronic devices are ruined by water damage, preventing her from making distress calls. Tami spots the lost dinghy with Richard clinging onto it and tries to sail the ship towards Richard but to no avail. After falling off the yacht and almost drowning, Tami has no choice but to make repairs to the ship in order to get it moving. She makes a makeshift sail using a broken pole and a storm jib (a triangular sail). She also uses a pump to prevent the cabin from flooding and then makes her way towards Richard. After successfully saving Richard, Tami realizes that Richard has broken ribs and a shattered right shin. While searching for food supplies, Tami realizes that she has a severe head injury and stitches the wound with a sail needle and thread.\nBack in 1983 (shortly before embarking on the ill-fated trip), Tami and Richard bump into Peter and Christine Crompton, owners of the Haza\u00f1a, a luxury Trintella 44 yacht. The Cromptons offer Richard $10,000 and a return first class ticket back to Tahiti to help them sail Haza\u00f1a to San Diego, California after a family emergency in London. Richard accepts the offer, with a condition that Tami comes along. Tami later explains to Richard that she isn't ready to return home yet but changes her mind. Richard proposes to Tami with a handmade ring, which Tami accepts.\nBack in real-time, Tami finds out they are off-course and decides to change course to Hawaii. Tami awakens and sees a tanker heading straight for the Haza\u00f1a. She fires multiple flares but the ship sails right past them and disappears after. Tami realises she has been hallucinating. Richard begins to suffer from high fever but reminds Tami that the sky was red in the morning, which signifies a storm approaching. Tami prepares Richard and herself for the storm by creating a makeshift shelter.\nCutting back to shortly before the hurricane struck, Tami and Richard receive news of the impending Hurricane Raymond but decide to continue to San Diego, with a slight diversion northward to attempt to avoid the central area of the hurricane, which has the highest winds and the roughest seas. Tami tries to radio for help but to no avail. The storm alters course unexpectectedly and the yacht then enters the eye of the storm. The ship struggles to stay afloat, the mainsail tears and the after boom breaks. Richard and Tami have no choice but to lower the sails to prevent the yacht from tipping over due to strong winds. While returning to the cockpit, Tami almost falls off the yacht after the ship hit turbulent waves. Richard professes his love for Tami and demands that she go below where she would be safer. Haza\u00f1a is flipped multiple times after encountering a rogue wave. Tami is thrown about in the cabin, thus suffering her severe head injury, and Richard is thrown overboard after he is knocked unconscious by the mast and his safety harness breaks. Richard slowly sinks into the depths of the ocean, while the Haza\u00f1a continues to flip multiple times and floats back to the surface thereafter.\nBack in real-time, Tami realizes that her perception of the injured Richard is nothing but a hallucination and surrenders to the reality that Richard has been lost at sea. Tami then sees islands in a distance and uses her binoculars to see better. She sees a Japanese research vessel in a distance and fires two flares in its direction. The research vessel then alters its course and heads towards Tami, rescuing her. Tami returns to Tahiti after recovering from her head injury and visits Richard's boat (the Mayaluga) and bursts into tears after seeing the wall of photos of Richard and her. Tami then goes to the beach with a frangipani flower and places her engagement ring from Richard around the flower and lets it go in the water.\nIt is then revealed in the credits that Richard Sharp was swept overboard and was never found, Tami Oldham was all alone aboard the Haza\u00f1a for 41 days and that she continues to sail to date.\n\nCast\nProduction\nAdrift was acquired by STX Entertainment in February 2017. The studio was set to produce and distribute the film, starring Shailene Woodley as Tami Oldham, and directed by Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur from a script by Aaron & Jordan Kandell. The Kandells and Woodley also produced the film, along with Korm\u00e1kur through his RVK Studios, and Ralph Winter. In April 2017, Miles Teller entered into negotiations to co-star opposite Woodley, whom he had collaborated with four times prior. However, in May 2017, Sam Claflin joined the film in the role meant for Teller, who had to pass due to \"scheduling conflicts.\"Principal photography on the film began in July 2017 in Fiji, and lasted five weeks. The cast and crew took two-hour boat rides into the ocean every day, and Woodley stated many members were seasick over the course of filming.\n\nMusic\n\"Where's My Love\" by SYML was featured in the first trailer for Adrift, which was released on March 14, 2018. \"Song For Zula\" by Phosphorescent was featured in the final trailer, released on May 7, 2018.\nAcademy Award-nominated composer Hauschka composed the original score for the film. The film's soundtrack includes his original score, and a cover of Tom Waits's \"I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You\", by Emil\u00edana Torrini. Also featured in the film but not on the soundtrack is \"Picture In A Frame\" by Waits, which is played during a montage scene of Tami Oldham Ashcraft before the end credits. The soundtrack has been released by Sony Classical and is available on Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon Music.\n\nRelease\nAdrift was released on June 1, 2018 in the United States by STX Entertainment. The film's $35 million production was mostly covered by foreign presales, totalling up to $20 million. STX accounted for $3 million out of the film's remaining $15 million budget (co-financed by Lakeshore Entertainment, Huayi Brothers, Ingenious), with an additional $25 million spent on promotion and advertisement.\n\nBox office\nAdrift grossed $31.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $28.5 million in other territories, for a total gross of $59.9 million, against a production budget of $35 million. In the United States and Canada, Adrift was released alongside Action Point and Upgrade, and was projected to gross $10\u201315 million from 3,015 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $4.2 million on its first day, including $725,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $11.6 million, finishing third, behind Solo: A Star Wars Story and Deadpool 2; 62% of its audience was female, with 69% being over the age of 25. The film fell 55% to $5.3 million in its second week, finishing sixth.\n\nHome Entertainment\nAdrift was released by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, in collaboration with STXfilms, on Digital HD on August 21, 2018 and DVD and Blu-ray on September 4, 2018. Special features include deleted scenes, 3 featurettes, theatrical trailers as well as a feature commentary by director Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur and leading actress and producer Shailene Woodley.\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71% based on 164 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Adrift sails smoothly between love story and survival drama, thanks in large part to a gripping central performance from Shailene Woodley.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \"B\u2013\" and praised Woodley's performance, saying: \"When all else fails, which it sometimes does, Woodley is there to right the ship. She's eminently believable as a whip-smart, hyper-capable, iron-willed human being who still finds a way to doubt herself... At its best, she wills Adrift into a moving story about a natural born wanderer who needs an anchor to know her own strength.\" Variety's Owen Gleiberman also noted the film's flaws while praising Woodley, writing, \"For long passages of Adrift, we're pleasantly engrossed without necessarily being riveted. The courtship, heartfelt as it is, has a glorified YA shimmer; the boat-adrift-at-sea sections are like All Is Lost without the ingenuity. But there's a hook, a surprise, a twist that carries you through.\"\n\nAccolades\nSee also\nAll Is Lost, a similarly themed 2013 movie.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAdrift on IMDb"

    "Text": "Agnyaathavaasi (lit. Prince in exile) is a 2018 Indian Telugu-language film directed by Trivikram Srinivas and starring Pawan Kalyan, with Keerthy Suresh, Anu Emmanuel, Aadhi Pinisetty, Kushboo, and Boman Irani in supporting roles. The film began principal photography on 3 April 2017. Aadhi Pinisetty played the main antagonist and Bollywood actor Parag Tyagi debuted as a villain. Work on the film commenced under the working title PSPK25, with the final release name revealed on 27 November 2017. The film was released on 10 January 2018, during the Sankranthi festival weekend and received negative reviews from critics. The film also flopped at the box office\n\nPlot\nGovinda \"Vindha\" Bhargav (Boman Irani), a powerful business magnate receives the news of his son Mohan Bhargav's death in a car accident while he is in Italy. Later, armed gunmen enter his hotel room, one of whom holds up a phone, and on the other end are Vindha's friends Sharma (Murali Sharma) and Varma (Rao Ramesh), who tell him this was their plan all along, and now with his son dead as well (implying that they planned it), his \"empire\" has no heir. Vindha secretly records this conversation before being gunned to death by the gunmen.\nThe news of Vindha's death, along with his belongings, reaches his wife Indrani Bhargav (Kushboo) who hears the audio file of Vindha's alleged killers. She calls her brother Appaji (Tanikella Bharani) to call for an unknown person. Appaji informs the unknown person, who is none other than Abhishikth Bhargav (Pawan Kalyan), Vindha's \"secret\" son. After performing his father's last rites in Varanasi, Abhi makes his way to Hyderabad, where his father's possible killers live. He scores a job in his office under the pseudonym Balasubramanyam, and makes friendships with Sukumari (Keerthy Suresh), Varma's daughter; and Suryakantham (Anu Emmanuel), Sharma's secretary who has a daughterly bond with Sharma. However, Abhi comes to know that the phone conversation must have been a fake one, since none of them have international calls registered on their phones, and now some unknown people are trying to kill him. Later that night, armed men break into his house and are killed by Abhi one after the other. The last one alive is killed in front of Indrani, only after revealing to them the true killer, Seetharam (Aadhi Pinisetty), Deenabandhu's (Sameer) (Vindha's ex-business partner who had died a few years ago) son.\nThe police investigation behind Vindha's death led by ACP Sampath (Sampath Raj) comes to conclusion when he contemplates about Vindha's past. Govindha Bharav, a middle-class man, had set up a successful pharmaceutical company who wished to set up a factory in a remote village. However, that plan failed as Vindha refuses to bribe a local politician, who responds by provoking the villagers to attack Vindha's factory with the help of Vindha's friend Aditya Bandaru (Ajay). While escaping in a charter plane with his friends except Aditya, they discover that the briefcase containing the vile for the medicine has been shot, destroying it. However, Vindha hides a second one in a secret compartment in the same briefcase. After viewing their celebrations, he begins doubting them as well. When he goes to Bali on a holiday with his pregnant wife, there is an attempt on her life. She is presumed dead, although she is alive. Vindha senses danger to her life, thus sending her away to her brother Appaji's house. She dies shortly after giving birth to Abhi, who is raised as a person agnostic to the concept of wealth acquisition, which Vindha deems as the primary quality for someone to lead his empire after him. With Abhi's consent, he marries Indrani, who is now a mother to Mohan Bhargav.\nAbhi takes over the company, proclaiming he is Vindha's son. He tortures Sharma, Varma, and Koteswara Rao (Raghu Babu), who had a habit of harassing women in the workplace. When this news reaches Seetharam, he comes back to India and asks for evidence to prove that Abhi is Vindha's son. Abhi goes to Bulgaria with Sukumari and Suryakantham to recover Vindha's will, which stated that his wealth must go to Abhi. However, that will is stolen by Seetharam with Appaji's help, and by threatening Sukumari and Suryakantham that he would kill Varma and Sharma. Seetharam destroys the will by burning, thus eradicating the evidence that Abhi is Vindha's son. However, when electing the future CEO for the company, Abhi fights Seetharam's goons on the roof of the building, after revealing that the will given to Seetharam was a fake one and that Appaji was part of Abhi's plan. After killing most of Seetharam's goons, one of the board members (Jayaprakash) of the company reveals to Abhi that he is Aditya's brother, and that he was part of Vindha's murder since he wanted to avenge his brother's death. After confronting Abhi, the board member is attacked by Seetharam's henchman Parag (Parag Tyagi), and they both slip off the rooftop. While Parag falls, Aditya's brother hangs by the logo of the company. After fighting Seetharam and telling him why he does not deserve the position of CEO, Abhi tells Aditya's brother that this company was a tribute to his friend, and the name of the company \"AB group\" was not named after him, but after Aditya. After that, the board member falls to his death. Abhi goes back into the company, takes the position of CEO, and promises Indrani that he will fulfill his father's duties.\n\nCast\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on 3 April 2017 with a small coffee shop scene, shot at Ciclo Cafe, then moved to a special set erected in Ramoji Film City for an action sequence. Some parts of the film were shot in Annapurna Studios and a major sequence and a song were shot in Bangkok. The unit moved to Bulgaria on 26 October 2017 for 15 days to shoot two songs. After the foreign schedule, shooting continued in Hyderabad and was completed by the end of November 2017, including a brief period of shooting at Varanasi.\n\nMusic\nThe soundtrack was composed by Anirudh Ravichander, making his Tollywood debut. The first song \"Baitikochi Chusthe\" was unveiled on 6 November 2017, the birthday of director Trivikram Srinivas.\n\nRelease\nThe film was released on 10 January 2018.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nTimes of India gave the film 2.5/5 stars, noting, \"Despite all the pomp and show, ... \u2018Agnyaathavaasi\u2019 has been an amazing ride had it either been taken seriously or been made with the same old Trivikram-Pawan Kalyan touch. However, the film lacks soul ... Pawan Kalyan aces through his role as usual, even if his body language and expressions ooze disinterest.\nThe Indian Express rated the film 2/5 and stated \"Agnyaathavaasi is not the film we expected to see this holiday. It is strictly for fans of Power Star as Trivikram has spent the entire runtime gushing over Pawan Kalyan.\"\n\nBox office\nThe film grossed \u20b990 crores against a budget of \u20b970 crores.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAgnyaathavaasi on IMDb"

    "Text": "Aiyaary (English: Disguising) is a 2018 Indian action thriller film written and directed by Neeraj Pandey. Produced by Shital Bhatia, Dhaval Gada & Motion Picture Capital and distributed by Reliance Entertainment, Plan C Studios, Friday Filmworks & Pen India Limited. The film features Sidharth Malhotra, Manoj Bajpayee, Rakul Preet Singh, Pooja Chopra, Adil Hussain, Kumud Mishra, Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. After having its release date rescheduled from 26 January to 9 February to yet another week, it was released on February 16, 2018The film is inspired from the Adarsh Housing society scam.\n\nPlot\nOne day while conducting Telephone surveillance in South Block, New Delhi, Major Jai Bakshi (Sidharth Malhotra), an officer in the classified special operations unit DSD (Data Systems Diagnostics), overhears a representative of Indian Arms lobby Lt.Gen Gurinder Singh (Retd) (Kumud Mishra), an ex Army officer, attempting to bribe the Army chief Pratap Malik (Vikram Gokhale), on behalf of a Czech firm, with a USD $2.5 Mn offer. Pratap flatly refuses and rebuffs the offer. This angers Gurinder, who in turn threatens to expose the DSD's existence to the general public. This makes Jai suspect a major scam involving the Indian Army. After 2 months of continuous surveillance, he goes rogue along with his girlfriend Sonia, a cyber-expert (Rakul Preet Singh), and escapes to London. Capt. Maya (Pooja Chopra) informs Colonel Abhay Singh (Manoj Bajpayee), their team leader and Jai's mentor, about Jai's going rogue and his stealing of highly sensitive data from the DSD Office. Abhay activates his intelligence network and launches a manhunt for Jai, eventually learning about Jai's escape along with Sonia. He raids Jai's house but  finds nothing. All this while, a special investigating Army Officer Brig. K Srinivas, spies on Abhay's movements and keeps reporting them to Gurinder. Abhay however outsmarts Srinivas and successfully manages to escape, and the DSD shift their office to an undisclosed location. Seeing his plan of capturing Abhay fail, Gurinder contacts an influential journalist and provides her with sensitive information, exposing Army's secrets.\nWhile all this is going on, Gen. Malik  meets Abhay and informs about the termination of DSD, Foreign involvement in Indian Defence Deals and Lt.Gen Gurinder Singh's involvement with a powerful London based Arms dealer Mukesh Kapoor (Adil Hussain), who's the major culprit behind all this fiasco. Abhay promises to expose the perpetrators to protect the integrity of Indian Army. After the meeting, with Srinivas still tracking him, Abhay heads to the DSD office, where he informs his team that they have been disavowed, with Government denying their existence. Abhay and Maya alert all their sources and order them to keep a low profile, so as to avoid detection. Abhay flies off to London, in pursuit of Jai, while DSD members stay back in India.\nIn London, Jai calls and threatens Gurinder in renegotiating a deal, revealing that he has bugged Gurinder's house. A frightened Gurinder reluctantly agrees and transfers the money to Jai's account. Abhay arrives in London and with the help of Tariq Bhai (Anupam Kher), a London-based immigrant and a middle-man for Intelligence agents, attempts to locate Jai and Sonia, but fails and instead alerts Jai. A desperate Abhay meets Mukesh Kapoor and informs him about Jai possessing sensitive incriminating data harmful for his business and thus asks him to eliminate Jai, apart from revealing the capture of Gurinder by DSD. However, Abhay informs Sonia about the threat to Jai's life and orders her to lure him to an undisclosed location. Jai's fixed meeting with a few MI-6 officers ends up in a shootout killing two agents. A wounded Jai makes it to the place where Abhay and Sonia are waiting for him. Abhay severely beats Jai and derides him as a traitor. Jai however justifies his actions and calls the older generation responsible for the massive corruption in India. He further questions the legacy that the older generation plans to leave for the youth, thus forcing Abhay to agree with him.\nFeeling cheated, Mukesh takes Tariq Bhai hostage and plans to execute him, but stops when Jai informs him that he will surrender all the sensitive information regarding Mukesh Kapoor's deals and requests for a personal meeting. Mukesh, realizing that Abhay still has Gurinder Singh, reluctantly agrees. Jai informs Abhay about a major Army housing scam in Mumbai, involving Gurinder Singh and the Defence Minister. He further tells that the only eyewitness to the entire scam, a watchman named Baburao Shastri (Naseeruddin Shah) is being hidden by Jai in a small hotel in Paharganj, Delhi. Abhay meets Baburao, records his confessions and gives them to the same influential journalist who earlier had met Gurinder Singh. She decides to run Abhay's story, thus deciding to expose the Army's housing scam.\nMeanwhile, Brig. Srinivas finally captures all the DSD members and frees Gurinder, but in turn the DSD is absolved of all the crimes and Army's Housing scam gets exposed. Gurinder Singh, overcome with shame and guilt, shoots himself dead.\n\nCast\nSidharth Malhotra as Major Jai Bakshi\nManoj Bajpayee as Colonel Abhay Singh\nRakul Preet Singh as Sonia Gupta\nPooja Chopra as Captain Maya Semwal\nAdil Hussain as Retd.

At the box office, it will be a disappointing fare.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV criticized the film saying that, \"Aiyaary, comatose and convoluted, is like a patient who's been wheeled in on a stretcher and declared dead on arrival. It never manages to get up on its feet and break into a saunter, let alone a sprint.\" and gave the film a rating of 1.5 stars out of 5. Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 1 star out of 5 and said that, \"Aiyaary is sketchily-written and not compelling. It tests patience even if you are a fan of the genre.\"Shrishti Negi of News 18 gave the film a rating of 1.5 stars out of 5 and said that, \"Unlike Pandey\u2019s other films, there is a nonsense of flatness in Aiyaary. Apart from a few scenes, the movie seems to be randomly constructed and fails to evoke any thrill.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nAiyaary on IMDb \nAiyaary at Bollywood Hungama"

    "Text": "Akasha (stylized as aKasha) is a 2018 Sudanese comedic film written and directed by Hajooj Kuka about a Sundanese soldier caught between his love for his girlfriend and his AK-47. Kuka previously directed several documentaries. Akasha is his first narrative film and premiered at the Venice Film Festival on August 31, 2018.\n\nPlot\nDuring the rainy season in the Nuba Mountains region, all sides of the South Sudanese Civil War are forced to halt fighting due to excessive mud, but when the rain stops, the war resumes. The film takes place on the day of akasha (lit.\u2009\"the round-up\"), when the rebel armed forces gather their troops to return to war. In the rebel-held area, Adnan stayed with his girlfriend Lina while on leave from the army for heroically shooting down a drone. He professes his love of Nancy, the name of his AK-47, that he constantly cleans and decorates with beads and ribbons. Lina is jealous of this \u201cother woman\u201d and throws Adnan out of the house, though they agree to meet at their special tree at noon. Adnan runs into Abdi, a pacifist trying to avoid conscription, who invites him to come to his hiding spot. Adnan still plans to return to the war, but he left his gun in Lina\u2019s house. If he returns without the gun he\u2019ll face one year in prison. Abdi agrees to retrieve the gun for Adnan. When Abdi tries to sneak into Lina's house, he accidentally turns on a loud boombox, which alerts the neighbors. They capture him and accuse him of theft, but he escapes during a subsequent air raid.\nNext, Abdi and Adnan disguise themselves as women to get the gun and avoid the soldiers. They pick out clothes, practice carrying water on their heads, and even borrow a baby to carry. The disguise is not convincing, as Adnan is quickly identified by an ex-girlfriend. In an attempt to diffuse the situation, he promises to go to a wedding with her later that day.\nLina waits at the special tree, but Adnan never shows. She returns home just in time to find Adnan and Abdi snatch the gun, and accuses them of theft. A village elder holds an informal trial, and the gun is determined to be Lina\u2019s property. Adnan can't return to the military without his gun, so Abdi leads Adnan to his hiding spot, where a witch doctor prepares a hallucinogenic flower for them. Adnan hallucinates and relives the moment when he shot down the drone. From their hiding place, Abdi spots a large group of enemy tanks approaching their village and decides to warn the general.\nAdnan shows up at the wedding, still high, looking for Lina and disrupts the festivities. He goes to the special tree, where his and Lina\u2019s names are carved. He goes to Lina\u2019s house, but is confronted by her and two other women with whom he flirted. He apologizes to Lina, admits that he actually has terrible aim and that the \"heroic\" drone shot was a lucky accident. The three women have enough of him, and give the gun Adnan.  However, the name Nancy is scratched out and replaced with the three women's names.\nAbdi warns the general about the approaching enemy forces, winning the general\u2019s favor. Adnan and Abdi climb into a truck and drive off to continue the fight.\n\nCast\nKamal Ramadan as Adnan\nEkram Marcus as Lina\nMohamed Chakado as Absi\nAbdallah Alnur as Blues\n\nProduction\nKuka met two of the lead actors, Mohamed Chakado and Kamal Ramadan, while teaching drama at a local youth centre, and decided to cast them in the film.\n\nRelease\nThe film premiered at the Venice Film Festival on August 31, 2018, and screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. Two of the actors, Kamal Ramadan and Mohamed Chakado, could not attend the festivals because Uganda refused to allow their departure while awaiting their refugee status papers. The film also screened at the Africa in Motion festival in Edinburgh.\n\nReception\naKasha received mixed reviews. Alvise Mainardi of Non Solo Cinema wrote that even though the low budget is evident, it's hard not to like it.  Martina Barone of Cinematographe felt that while the actors' performances often drag down the quality of the film, this debut shows that the director has a talent for film-making.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial Website\naKasha film notes from Toronto International Film Festival"

Both parts of the film were shot simultaneously. Dexter Studios, one of Asia's largest film production and visual effects studios, who was behind director Kim Yong-hwa's previous film Mr. Go (2013), created the visual effects for the film. It was reported that around 300 artists and technicians took part in the film's production.\nChinese production company Alpha Pictures invested $2.2 million.\nFilming began on May 26, 2016, and ended on March 22, 2017, for part 1 and 2.\nSome scenes that featured actors Oh Dal-su and Choi Il-hwa were re-shot due to their controversies as they were replaced with substitute actors.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 6 reviews and an average rating of 5.7/10.Elizabeth Kerr of The Hollywood Reporter gave a mixed review and wrote, \"Though the two films were shot simultaneously, there\u2019s a sense of \"more\" to Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days that doesn\u2019t really do it any service. Like many a sequel bent on topping its predecessor to prove the first entry wasn\u2019t a fluke, the end result is just a bigger, noisier, less focused slog rather than continued world-building.\"Noel Murray of Los Angeles Times gave a mixed review and wrote, \"While Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days is awkwardly bloated, it does eventually develop some momentum. Once viewers get accustomed to a movie that can move within minutes from courtroom drama to dinosaur attacks, they may enjoy the overwhelming spectacle of it all.\"\n\nBox office\nSouth Korea\nPrior to its release, Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days set the record for the highest pre-sale tickets in South Korea's box office history with 60.5% reservation rate.

    "Text": "Alpha is a 2018 American historical adventure film directed by Albert Hughes and written by Daniele Sebastian Wiedenhaupt, from a story by Hughes. The film stars Kodi Smit-McPhee as a young hunter who befriends an injured dire wolf during the last ice age, with J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson as his father. The wolf is played by Chuck, a five-year-old Czechoslovakian Wolfdog.Principal photography began in February 2016 in Canada and lasted through that April. The film was delayed several times, before being released in the United States on August 17, 2018, by Sony Pictures Releasing. It has grossed over $98 million worldwide and received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised the performances and cinematography.\n\nPlot\nIn Upper Paleolithic Europe 20,000 years ago, a small tribe of hunter-gatherers prepare for a hunting expedition to hunt for the coming winter's food. Tau, its chief, trains his teenage son Keda, accepting him and another boy to join the hunting party. His wife Rho worries that Keda is not ready, but Tau believes he is and the hunters set out.\nTau tests Keda by having him kill a wild boar they've caught, but Keda hesitates. One night, the party's fire draws the attention of a large cave lion, which lunges through their circle, snatching Keda's friend before anyone can do anything. Hearing the fatal struggle in the darkness, the tribe gives him up for dead. The member is given a memorial service in the form of placing rocks to symbolize the passing of one's spirit to the afterlife.\nThe hunters eventually reach a herd of steppe bison, which they attempt to stampede off a cliff in relative success. Amidst the chaos, the chief bison rushes towards Keda and throws him over the edge, leaving him gripping the rough cliff edge with his hand. Keda loses his grip and falls to a further ledge where he appears to break his leg and is knocked unconsciousness. Tau attempts to climb down to him, but he is stopped by another member of the tribe who assures him in good faith that Keda is dead and there would be no way to reach him nonetheless. The tribe leaves and Tau performs another funeral ritual, stricken with grief.\nKeda is awoken by a vulture who mistakes him for dead. Keda smacks the bird away and tries to climb the rest of the way down the cliff. A sudden heavy rainfall causes the ravine below to flood. Losing his grip, Keda jumps into the water. He survives and splints his injured foot before returning to the top of the cliff. Seeing the memorial cairn left by his tribe, he realizes he must trek back to the village by himself.\nKeda is later attacked by a pack of wolves, but escapes up a tree and wounds one of them which the others leave behind. Keda takes pity on it and cares for its injury. Gradually gaining the wolf's trust, he gives it water and then food, establishing himself as dominant by feeding himself first. He sets out for the village without the wolf, but it follows him. Their relationship grows, and they learn to hunt animals together. Along the way, Keda names the wolf Alpha.\nOne night, they are approached menacingly by another pack of dire wolves. They hesitate upon seeing Alpha, who steps forward and greets them. The pack run off and with Keda's blessing, Alpha joins them.\nKeda continues his journey alone as the season changes to winter. On a frozen lake, he encounters a pack of wolves feeding. Recognizing Alpha, he runs to them, but the ice breaks and he falls through. Alpha helps rescue him and they are reunited.\nContinuing the journey together, they find a man who has frozen outside his tent and scavenge a bow and arrow from it. Later, they take refuge from cave hyenas in a cave where they are attacked by the same cave lion that killed Keda's friend. Alpha brutally fights the cave lion and Keda fires the arrow at the animal, killing it. However, Alpha is badly injured in the fight and now travels with difficulty.

    "Text": "Amazing China (Chinese: \u5389\u5bb3\u4e86, \u6211\u7684\u56fd) is a 2018 Chinese documentary film that displays China's achievements in science, technology, industry, and poverty reduction since Xi Jinping took power of General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 2012. Internationally, it is widely considered to be a propaganda film, and an effort by the Communist Party of China to increase its soft power. It was co-produced by the China Central Television and China Film Co., Ltd, and released in Mainland China on March 2, 2018, distributed by Alibaba Pictures. The director is Wei Tie. On 19 April 2018, the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China issued a memo requesting that Chinese websites and cinemas stop showing the film. The film was screened in a theater in Macao from May 9 to May 14 in 2018.The content of the film is from a six-episode TV documentary with the same English title shown in 2017 (Chinese title: \u8f89\u714c\u4e2d\u56fd), including the construction of the China Railway High-speed, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. The film also is believed to be a significant step towards a personality cult of Xi Jinping by some observers.It was reported by South China Morning Post that some state companies and government-affiliated organizations required employees to watch the film. Douban, the leading film review website in China, disabled the comments and rating functions of the film, instead the page of the film showed a so-called \"media rating\" of 8.5/10, with a collection of reviews written by several state media including Xinhua and the People's Daily.The original Chinese title of the film is \"\u5389\u5bb3\u4e86, \u6211\u7684\u56fd\" (pinyin: l\u00echaile, w\u01d2de gu\u00f3 roughly translates to \"Amazing, My Country\"), and derives from the online slang expression \"\u5389\u5bb3\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u54e5\", meaning \"bravo, my brother\",  often used by several official social media accounts of state organizations like the Communist Youth League of China.Huajian Group, a Chinese shoe making company hiring thousands of Ethiopians, was portrayed in the film as a model of \"introducing China's experience of prosperity to Africa.\" According to a report of the Associated Press, though, the company's Ethiopian workers complained about low wages, the lack of safety equipment, forced labor and not being permitted to form a trade union.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAmazing China on IMDb \nAmazing China on YouTube"

    "Text": "American Animals is a 2018 British-American crime drama film written and directed by Bart Layton. The film stars Evan Peters, Barry Keoghan, Blake Jenner, Jared Abrahamson, and Ann Dowd. It is based on the true story of a library heist that happened at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky in 2004. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2018 and was released in the United States on June 1, 2018, by The Orchard and MoviePass Ventures. It was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on September 7, 2018, by STX International. The film received critical acclaim, with many praising the cast's performances.\n\nPlot\nThe storytelling frequently jumps between interviews with the real people portrayed in the film and the events themselves performed by actors.\nIn 2003 in Lexington, Kentucky, Spencer Reinhard is an art student who feels his life has no meaning, that he needs something exciting, even if tragic, to happen in his life to inspire greater artistry. Warren Lipka is a rebellious student on an athletic scholarship, though he does not care much for sports and is only pursuing the education to please his family.\nAfter Spencer is given a tour of Transylvania University library's rare book collection, the two friends begin to plan to steal an extremely valuable edition of John James Audubon's The Birds of America and other rare books. Warren travels to Amsterdam to meet some black market buyers who express interest in buying the books. Upon returning to the US, he informs Spencer that they could make millions of dollars, much to their excitement.\nRealizing that pulling off the heist will require more people, they enlist the help of childhood friends Erik Borsuk, who helps provide the logistics of the operation, and Chas Allen, who will be the getaway driver. They all take time to prepare, learning that the only person guarding the books is the special collections librarian, Betty Jean Gooch.\nOn the day of the robbery, they disguise themselves as elderly businessmen, and enter the library. After noticing that there are too many people in the special collections library, they quickly abort the heist and retreat. Three of the conspirators want to end the attempt altogether, but Warren calls the library asking for a private appointment the next day.\nThey decide to drop the elaborate old-age disguises. While Spencer acts as a lookout outside the building, Warren and Eric enter the library dressed as young businessmen. Warren clumsily tases the special collections librarian and makes Eric help tie her up and gag her. They take the rare books and blunder to an exit. In a panic, they drop and have to leave behind the biggest prizes, two enormous Audubon books comprising \"The Birds of America.\" All four manage to escape with two of the rarer books.\nThey take the books to Christie's auction house in New York to get the authentication of value that Warren had said the Dutch buyers required. Spencer is told he has to come back sometime the next day and leaves his cell phone number with an auction assistant. In the van outside, Chas berates everyone for their stupidity, and they return to Lexington with the books. Shortly after, Spencer realizes that the police will be able to trace them from emails they used in setting up the heist as well as his cell phone number.\nThe thieves show signs of great stress as they try to lie low: Warren attempts to shoplift from a grocery store; Spencer gets into a car accident; and Eric starts a bar fight. Inevitably, the FBI raid all four of their homes and arrest them. Movie titles show they each were sentenced to 7 years in federal prison.\nAfter prison, the real-life robbers express their regret for attempting the heist, noting how much pain they have put their families through. It is also revealed that Warren may have lied about going to Amsterdam, fabricating the story to get the others to agree to the heist. However, this is not confirmed.\nAn epilogue describes their lives after prison. Eric lives in Los Angeles as a writer, and Chas has become a fitness coach in Southern California. Warren has re-enrolled in college and studies filmmaking in Philadelphia. Spencer still lives in Lexington making a living as an artist, specializing in birds. Betty Jean Gooch, the librarian, still works at Transylvania University as a special collections librarian.\n\nCast\nEvan Peters as Warren Lipka\nBarry Keoghan as Spencer Reinhard\nBlake Jenner as Chas Allen\nJared Abrahamson as Eric Borsuk\nUdo Kier as Mr. Van Der Hoek\nAnn Dowd as Betty Jean GoochWarren Lipka, Spencer Reinhard, Chas Allen, Eric Borsuk and Betty Jean Gooch all appear as themselves. Gary Basaraba and Lara Grice portray Warren's parents, Jane McNeill portrays Spencer's mother, and Whitney Goin portrays Chas's mother. Wayne Duvall appears as Coach Bill Welton.\n\nProduction\nFilming began in Charlotte, North Carolina, in February 2017. Many of the scenes were filmed on campus at Davidson College.  The title comes from Eric Borsuk's memoir, which derives its name from a passage in On the Origin of Species, one of the books stolen by the gang, about animals dwelling in the cave systems of Kentucky.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe score and themes were composed by Anne Nikitin.

Speaking about Animals, as well as MoviePass Ventures' other film Gotti, one independent studio head told Deadline Hollywood: \"It used to be in distribution, we'd all gossip whether a studio was buying tickets to their own movie to goose their opening. But in the case of MoviePass, there's no secret: They're literally buying the tickets to their own movie!\"\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 187 reviews, and an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"American Animals tangles with a number of weighty themes, but never at the expense of delivering a queasily compelling true crime thriller.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAmerican Animals on IMDb \nAmerican Animals at Rotten Tomatoes"

    "Text": "The American Meme is a 2018 documentary film starring Paris Hilton, Josh Ostrovsky, Kirill Bichutsky, Brittany Furlan, Hailey Baldwin, DJ Khaled, Emily Ratajkowski and Dane Cook. It is written and directed by Bert Marcus and produced by Bert Marcus and Cassandra Thornton, and premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 27, 2018.The film follows four social media personalities as they work to create commercial brands out of their online presence. The film premiered to critical acclaim  and was purchased at the Tribeca Film Festival as a Netflix Original Documentary. The sale was one of the most high-profile documentary acquisitions of this year.The film was released on December 7, 2018 on Netflix.\n\nCritical reception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a user approval rating of 99%, with an average of 4.9/5, and 93% among critic reviews.  \nTime Out New York named it the number one movie to see at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival, writing that the documentary \"finds its way to an unexpected sadness and maybe something deeper and cautionary.\"Owen Gleiberman of Variety, hailed it as \"highly entertaining and an essential snapshot of the narcotic voyeuristic parasitic American fishbowl,\" following its premiere at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival. He went on to say, \"Bert Marcus, the director of 'The American Meme,' works in a kaleidoscopic style that channels the glitzy, fragmented screen-shot spirit of his subjects. At the same time, he gets us close to them, so that we can see the kind of people they are: shrewdly likable and kind of ordinary. Their lives consist of feeding a beast that pumps their fame and drains their souls.\" Internet film critic, S. James Wegg writes, \"[Bert] Marcus set himself the task of profiling some of the world\u2019s most 'followed' social media superstars, letting their work and their own voices make his points about the business of making a living doing outrageous things and sharing those with their seemingly insatiable admirers and online 'family.'\"Paris Hilton, one the film's central characters, has been praised for showing her vulnerability and giving audiences a glimpse into the dark side of fame. Decider reports, \"In a series of quiet, reflective interviews, Hilton explains why she trusts her fans more than her friends and dissects the risqu\u00e9 David LaChappelle photoshoot that transformed her into a household name.\" Furthermore, USA Today shares \"5 ways Netflix's 'The American Meme' will change the way you think about Paris Hilton,\" including the closeness she has with her fans and her genuine self-awareness about the reality of internet stardom and notoriety.\nIn a review of the film in The New Yorker, Naomi Fry writes, \"But what is fascinating, and valuable, about 'The American Meme' is its ability to reveal the desperation, loneliness, and sheer Sisyphean tedium of ceaselessly chasing what will most likely end up being an ever-diminishing share of the online-attention economy.\" Bust reports, \"'The American Meme' unpacks and reveals the ecosystem of social media celebrity with incredible thoughtfulness....this movie is no hand-wringing thinkpiece from a legacy publication about how the Young People and their Insta-whatevers are ruining society, written with an insufferably lofty tone by an outsider. What Marcus does, radically enough, is treat the social media personalities he interviews for this film as real people, rather than subjects in a study or avatars of moral degradation.\"The film has been hailed by The Irish Times as \"a fascinating look into the curious appeal and lives of social media superstars and reality celebrities.\"\n\nReferences\nReviews\nTHE AMERICAN MEME: Stretching The Fifteen Minutes Of Fame\n[1]The American Meme on IMDb \nThe American Meme on Netflix\nFilm Review: \u2018The American Meme\u2019\n\u201cThe American Meme,\u201d a New Netflix Documentary, Records the Angst of Social-Media Influencers\nThe 10 best movies at Tribeca Film Festival 2018 \nTHE AMERICAN MEME \nFilm Review: \u201cThe American Meme\u201d Does Justice to Vapid Cultural #Phenoms \nTHE AMERICAN MEME: The Fleeting Nature Of Fame Awaits \nThe Age of Digital Influencers: in pursuit of fame\nA Documentary For Our Time: \u2018The American Meme\u2019 Asks the Cost of Instagram Fame \nNetflix\u2019s doc The American Meme challenges the reality of social-media stars\nFilm Review: The American Meme on Film Threat\n\"The American Meme\" Is Most Disturbing Movie Of The Year"
